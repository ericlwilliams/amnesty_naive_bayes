an almost impossible standard to meet. the appeal courts have continued to fail to address many of the deeply disturbing issues in browns case. in the rejection of the last appeal, the north carolina supreme court cited the overwhelming evidence against brown, including: the discovery of his ring on the victims body, his bloody palm print on the wall over the girl's body, and the bloody footprints from the victims apartment to his (they lived in the same building). amnesty international believes the evidence against brown is far from conclusive. the ring did belong to brown and is undoubtedly a powerful piece of evidence against him. he claims he lost the ring after taking it off at a party where he was playing records the night before the crime. however, other evidence is much weaker than it first appears. the testimony at trial was consistent with the palm print having been placed on the wall weeks or months before the murders. apparently, it was not possible to tell whether the print was made by a bloody hand or the blood had splashed over it. brown had been in the victims apartment prior to the crime helping her move furniture. no other finger prints belonging to brown were found at the scene. thirty three other prints that did not match either victim were found but not identified. the police appear to have ignored the two other possible suspects for the crime, one of whom was positively identified by two witnesses as jumping from the balcony of the apartment block around the time of the murders. according to press reports, when the witnesses reported what they had seen, the police officers investigating the case told them, we got our man and yall arent doing but one thing, helping a murderer get set free. the trail of blood, as it is so often referred to in the media or by prosecutors, was in fact not visible to the naked eye. it was only discovered by highly sensitive forensic tests that were incapable of identifying the source of the blood. the authorities have failed to explain how a highly intoxicated individual, who would have been covered in blood after such a brutal crime, was able to clean himself and dispose of his clothing without leaving any trace of blood in his apartment, including in his drains, in such a short space of time. successive appeal courts have refused to grant legal relief to david brown, while continually acknowledging the faults in his trial. the court of appeals for the 4th circuit found that the district attorneys denial of pre-trial access to the crime scene and to witnesses was an error of a constitutional nature, but determined the error was harmless. a judge for the district court concluded that the conduct of the da was inexcusable, based on personal animosity (towards the defence attorney), that the das gamesmanship was especially abhorrent when a persons life is at stake, but that it was also harmless (in that it would not have affected the outcome of the trial). amnesty international is appalled that the latest and probably last round of browns legal appeals have once again failed to adequately address the apparent numerous violations of the us constitution and international standards governing the death penalty. for the diminishing list of countries which still resort to the death penalty, international human rights standards require the very highest level of fairness in capital cases, given the irreversible nature of the penalty. amnesty international is not in a position to know whether brown is guilty or innocent of these murders. however, the case has many of the troubling aspects that have been present in the cases of the 82 people released from death row after being exonerated in the usa since 1973. the execution of david brown would clearly be in contravention of numerous international laws and standards, including article 4 of the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, which states: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. browns only remaining option is to seek clemency from the governor. in north carolina, governor jim hunt has sole authority to grant clemency. hunt has never commuted a death sentence in his seven years in office (nor in the eight years he previously served). no other north carolina governor has held office for so long without granting clemency to a condemned prisoner. further recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail","","1998-12-15",2,TRUE

(on 11 march 2000, some 1,100 prisoners at st catherine's district prison and kingston general penitentiary suffered acute diarrhea caused by food served in both prisons.) inmates have also complained about being confined to their cells for extended periods. during the attacks warders reportedly targeted those inmates known to be supportive of the head of correctional services, colonel john prescod. colonel prescod has reportedly ordered an internal investigation into whether ""the force that was used was necessary and appropriate."" inmates are allegedly also being denied visits from friends and relatives and their mail is being withheld. background information amnesty international has repeatedly expressed its concerns regarding alleged excessive use of force, in some cases appearing to amount to extrajudicial executions; excessive force during cell searches; prison conditions and other ill-treatment in st. catherine's prison and other prisons in jamaica.  in december 1993, amnesty international called for an inquiry into deaths and ill-treatment of prisoners in st. catherine's prison. soldiers have been manning the prison since around 800 warders went on unofficial strike in january 2000 in protest against the reappointment of colonel john prescod as head of corrections. they were later indicted. their anger stemmed in part from his decision in 1997 to distribute condoms throughout prisons. this led to rioting, in which 17 inmates were killed, allegedly because they were thought to be gay. since then amnesty international has continued to receive reports of ill-treatment in both st. catherine's and the general penitentiary, as well as of the failure of guards to protect inmates from inmate-upon-inmate violence, in contravention of international standards. conditions in jamaica's prisons amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and fall well below international minimum standards on prisons.  overcrowding is severe and conditions unsanitary. the jamaican constitution guarantees all citizens the right to life, liberty, security of the person; the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of life; the right not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment. further recommended action: please send telegrams/telexes/faxes/express/ airmail letters urging that: - immediate steps be taken to ensure that inmates are protected from further violence; and to ensure that inmates making complaints are protected from physical and other reprisals by soldiers or warders; - that all those injured receive immediate, medical attention; -  that a full, independent inquiry into the allegations take place, with the findings and recommendations made public within a reasonable period of time and with those responsible brought to justice; - that warders and soldiers alleged to have been involved in the beatings should be transferred from the prison where these took place while the case is being investigated; - that policies and practice regarding the use of force and conditions in prison be immediately reviewed, to ensure conformance with jamaica's obligations as a state party to the international covenant on civil and political rights, the american convention and to ensure adherence to relevant international standards, including the un standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners. appeals to: the rt. hon. p.j. patterson prime minister office of the prime minister jamaica house 1 devon road kingston 6 jamaica","","2000-04-28",2,TRUE

those who commit crimes when under 18 years old. the ban is so widely accepted, and adhered to, that it has become a principle of customary international law, binding on countries regardless of which international instruments they have or have not ratified. the only four executions of child offenders known in the world since october 1997 have all been carried out in the usa. in the past decade, the usa has carried out 10 of the 19 known executions of child offenders. chris thomas is one of three child offenders scheduled to be put to death in the usa in january 2000 (see shame in the 21st century: three child offenders scheduled for execution in january 2000, amr 51/189/99, december 1999). the global ban on the use of the death penalty against child offenders does not seek to excuse their crimes or belittle the suffering caused, but only to recognize a childs immaturity and capacity for change. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - expressing deep concern that douglas christopher thomas is facing execution in violation of international law which bans the use of the death penalty against those who commit crimes when under 18 years old; - explaining that this international ban does not seek to excuse violent crimes committed by children, but rather to recognize childrens immaturity and their capacity for change; - expressing concern that the expert who presented mitigating evidence for the defense had 24 hours to prepare and has since noted that the defense teams presentation at sentencing was inadequate; - noting post-trial evidence supporting chris thomass claim that he did not fire the third shot, and that this casts doubt over whether the jury would have recommended death if they had heard such evidence; -

- expressing concern that ali matouri-zadehs and fahima ismail badawis trials appear to be have been unfair, and asking for details of their trial proceedings, including the specific charges against them, whether they had access to independent lawyers of their choice, and whether they were allowed to appeal against their convictions and sentences, as required by article 14 (5) of the international covenant on civil and political rights; - expressing concern that ali matouri-zadeh may have been compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt during interrogations which did not respect the necessary human rights safeguards, such as the right to access to legal counsel;

blaise barankoreho was beaten at the time of his arrest. when, on 10 august, relatives of flicien gasana tried to visit him at the brigade, they were told he had been taken to kigali hospital (centre hospitalier de kigali). when they enquired at the hospital, they were told he had died the previous day. his body, which was in the morgue, bore visible wounds indicating severe blows to his head and face. the commander of the brigade at nyamirambo claimed that flicien gasana had been taken ill but was still alive when taken to hospital. other sources have indicated, however, that he may have been dead on arrival. his family say that he was in good health before being arrested. it is not yet known whether their request for an autopsy has been granted. a request by epiphanie uwitakiyes family that she be allowed to attend her husbands funeral on 11 august - accompanied by security officials if necessary - was refused. the motives for these arrests and for the killing of flicien gasana are not known. some believe that these events are linked to the two couples attempts to claim back their property; in an attempt in 1996 to reclaim their property, another relative of blaise barankoreho had been beaten. the group who arrested them have accused them of participating in the genocide in nyamirambo in 1994, which the commander of the brigade has cited as the basis for their arrest. background information human rights abuses in the context of disputes over property are common in rwanda. amnesty international has documented many cases of people who have been arrested, disappeared or killed following attempts to reclaim their property which has been illegally occupied. in some cases, these abuses are carried out by military or other agents of the state, in other cases by private individuals. the authorities have done little to investigate arbitrary arrests, killings and disappearances in this context or to bring those responsible to justice. unsubstantiated accusations of participation in the genocide in rwanda and denunciations by organized groups are also common. the accusation of participation in the genocide is often used to settle scores or as a form of revenge. amnesty international is not in a position to state whether the three individuals above are guilty or innocent of these crimes, but is concerned about their safety as well as about arrest procedures. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters in french or english or your own language: - expressing concern for the safety of epiphanie uwitakiye, blaise barankoreho and suzanne in detention, following the death of flicien gasana;

(see usa: failing the future: death penalty developments, march 1998 - march 2000, amr 51/03/00, april 2000, page 66). on 11 june 2000, the chicago tribune published the findings of its study into the 131 (now 132) executions carried out in texas during governor bushs term of office. it found that the problems plaguing illinois are equally pronounced in texas and that additional flaws undermine the states administration of societys ultimate punishment. the problems identified by the paper include the use of unreliable evidence and inadequate defense counsel, as occurred in gary grahams case. on 7 june governor glendening of maryland stopped the execution of eugene colvin-el because it is not appropriate to proceed with an execution when there is any level of uncertainty. the case of gary graham is riddled with uncertainty. the usa is world leader in executing prisoners for crimes committed when they were under 18. amnesty international has learned of another such execution in the democratic republic of congo. on 15 january 2000, 14-year-old kasongo was executed shortly after his murder trial. this means that since september 1997 there have been nine executions of child offenders reported worldwide, seven of them in the usa (the other was in iran). recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters in your own words using the following guide: - expressing deep concern that shaka sankofa, formerly gary graham, is scheduled for execution for a crime committed when he was 17, in violation of international law; - expressing concern that serious doubts remain about his guilt in the crime for which he was sentenced to death; - noting the widespread concern about wrongful capital convictions in the usa, which has led the governor of illinois to suspend executions in his state; - noting that on 7 june governor glendening of maryland stopped the execution of eugene colvin-el, because it is not appropriate to proceed with an execution when there is any level of uncertainty; - pointing out that uncertainty runs through the case of gary graham; - noting governor bushs repeated assurances that he will not allow people to be executed whose guilt is in doubt; - calling for this execution to be stopped. appeals to: the honorable george w. bush governor of texas po box 12428 austin, tx 78711-2428","","2000-05-05",2,TRUE

in february 2003 the united nations human rights committee (hrc) urged the uzbek authorities to stay both executions while they sought to establish whether provisions of the international covenant on civil and political rights had been violated during the investigation, trial and appeal process. in december 2003 the authorities assured the committee that they would comply with the request for a stay of execution. background information the authorities have never disclosed comprehensive statistics on the application of the death penalty in uzbekistan, although, as a member of the organization for security and co-operation in europe, the country has committed itself to make available to the public information regarding the use of the death penalty. amnesty international has recorded 20 death sentences and 28 executions for 2003. however, these figures are believed to reflect only a fraction of the true figure, as it is very likely that most death row prisoners and their families do not have access to anyone who will record, publicize or take action on their cases. several local human rights groups believe that more than 200 people are executed in uzbekistan every year. including abror isaevs case, at least 13 people have had their death sentences reversed after their cases were raised by local activists and the international community in the past three-and-a-half years. in 11 of these cases the hrc had intervened, urging the authorities to stay the execution while the committee considered each case. however, at least nine other death row prisoners have been executed despite interventions by the hrc. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - welcoming the reversal of abror isaevs death sentence; - urging the president to commute the death sentence of nodirbek karimov; - requesting the authorities to confirm that nodirbek karimov is not going to be executed while his case is under consideration by the united nations human rights committee; - expressing concern at allegations that the two men were ill-treated while in pre-trial detention and urging the authorities to open a prompt and impartial investigation into these allegations, with the findings made public and anyone found responsible brought to justice; - stating that you have learnt that abror isaev became mentally disturbed while on death row, and asking for assurances that abror isaev will receive appropriate medical treatment; - expressing your unconditional opposition to the death penalty as a violation of the most fundamental of human rights, the right to life, and calling on the authorities to take decisive steps towards the abolition of the death penalty. appeals to: (please note that it can be difficult getting through to fax numbers in uzbekistan. if a voice answers, repeat fax until you hear the signal;

now goes to governor brad henry, who can accept or reject it. he can also issue a temporary reprieve. osvaldo torres is scheduled to be executed on 18 may 2004 for a double murder committed in 1993. he was sentenced to death in 1996. at the clemency hearing, the mexican ambassador to the usa appealed for the death sentence not to be carried out. osvaldo torres was denied his consular rights under the vienna convention on consular relations (vccr). under article 36 of the vccr, the authorities must notify all detained foreign nationals without delay of their right to have their consulate informed of their detention. osvaldo torress case featured in a 31 march 2004 judgment by the international court of justice (icj), in a case brought by mexico on behalf of its nationals on us death rows, that the usa had violated its vccr obligations and that it must provide effective judicial review and reconsideration of the impact of the violations in the cases of the foreign nationals involved. at the time of his arrest, osvaldo torres was an 18-year-old without a lawyer who had had minimal contact with the us criminal justice system. he was registered with the immigration authorities as a resident alien, which would have become known to the police when they conducted a routine background check on him upon his arrest. despite this, the authorities never informed him of his rights under the vccr. mexico only learned of the case in 1996 when his family contacted the mexican consulate for help. by then, osvaldo torres had already been convicted and sentenced to death. timely assistance from the mexican consulate could have prevented the imposition of the death penalty, either by persuading the prosecutor not to seek a death sentence or by assisting the defence at the trial. the crime in question was the murder of maria yanez and her husband francisco morales, who were shot dead in their oklahoma city home in july 1993. their 14-year-old daughter was woken by gunfire and rang the police. on their way to the house, police arrested george ochoa and osvaldo torres not far from the crime scene. the two men were tried jointly on charges of first degree burglary and first degree murder with malice aforethought. on this latter charge, the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant intended to kill the victims. according to the oklahoma court of criminal appeals,  ;the states theory, which is supported by the evidence, shows that torres was not the shooter. in order to o btain a first degree murder conviction, the state therefore had to prove that osvaldo torres personally intended the death of the victim and aided and abetted with full knowledge of the intent of the perpetrator. the state produced some evidence which, although not watertight, tended to show that osvaldo torres was present at or near the crime. the evidence in support of the aiding and abetting theory was not strong, however, with no evidence presented that osvaldo torres committed, planned or helped to plan the murders, or knew that his co-defendant planned to kill. george ochoa remains on death row, without an execution date. one of the states witnesses, a 15-year-old girl, testified that the man she saw with george ochoa before the crime had carried a gun. the pistol she described at trial, never found, was not the weapon used in the murders. this witness has since recanted her testimony and said that she was coerced by the prosecution into saying that she saw a gun. despite her affidavit, the oklahoma court of criminal appeals relied upon her trial testimony in upholding torress conviction for first degree murder with malice aforethought: the circumstantial evidence supports a finding of intent, particularly given the evidence that torres had a gun with him prior to the killings (emphasis added). the 10th circuit court of appeals has in turn upheld the conviction and death sentence, despite acknowledging that the evidence against torres is susceptible to interpretation. one of the three judges wrote: i do not believe that the evidence is sufficient to support mr torress murder convictions. at the clemency hearing on 7 may, osvaldo torres told the pardon and parole board: ""i'm not going to sit here and tell you i never did anything wrong. he acknowledged that he intended to burgle the house where the victims were shot. he said, however, that ""i never killed anyone, and i never knew george was going to kill anyone."" six of the seven recommendations for clemency made by the state pardon and parole board in capital cases since 2001 have been rejected by governor henry or his predecessor. for more detail see: usa: osvaldo torres, mexican national denied consular rights, scheduled to die , ai index: amr 51/057/2004, 2 april 2004,","update","2004-04-02",2,TRUE

- expressing concern at evidence that d.h. fleenor may be mentally ill and may not understand the nature of and reason for his punishment, and pointing out that international standards forbid the execution of prisoners who have become insane; - noting that d.h. fleenors case has been marked by at least two relatives who were present at the shooting speaking out against the death sentence; - pointing out that a growing number of relatives of us murder victims are speaking out against the death penalty, arguing that an execution does nothing to ease their grief, and only perpetuates a culture of violence; - expressing concern that the catholic chaplain at indiana state prison has been stopped from visiting death row inmates because of philosophical differences stemming from his opposition to the death penalty;

- expressing concern, however, that john paul penry is facing execution, in contravention of international standards against the use of the death penalty for persons suffering from mental retardation or extremely limited mental competence, whether at the stage of sentence or execution; - noting that in 12 of the usas 38 death penalty states, the execution of john paul penry would be prohibited (arkansas, colorado, georgia, indiana, kansas, kentucky, maryland, nebraska, new mexico, new york, tennessee and washington have all legislated against executing the mentally retarded); - urging that john paul penrys sentence be commuted as a first step towards texas joining this growing national consensus, and in line with international standards of justice; - noting that governor bush has been campaigning for the us presidency under the slogan compassionate conservatism, and suggesting that john paul penry has a compelling case for executive compassion. appeals to: gerald garrett chairman of the board of pardons and paroles executive clemency unit price daniel, sr. bldg., texas board of pardons and paroles p.o. box 13401 austin, tx 78711-3401","","",2,TRUE

non-performance of it constitutes internationally wrongful conduct. any aspects of domestic law hindering compliance were no excuse, the icj emphasized. on 14 june 2011, senator patrick leahy introduced a bill in us congress aimed at implementing the icj judgment, as well as facilitating compliance with article 36 of the vccr. lawyers for humberto leal sought a stay of execution long enough to allow to congress to act on the legislation. the courts refused to grant a stay. the texas board of pardons and paroles voted against a reprieve to allow time for congress to act, despite three judges on the texas court of criminal appeals urging an executive reprieve. the three judges noted that it is precisely when the judicial department proves institutionally unequal to the task that the exercise of executive clemency is most appropriate. the us supreme court refused to grant a stay on 7 july, over the dissent of four of the nine justices. both the us and mexican government had filed legal briefs in the supreme court supporting the request for a stay of execution (see overleaf). the courts majority noted that the us administration and the dissenting justices complain of the grave international consequences that will follow from leals execution, but added that congress evidently did not find these consequences sufficiently grave to prompt its enactment of implementing legislation, and we will follow the law as written by congress. we have no authority to stay an execution in light of an appeal of the president, presenting free-ranging assertions of foreign policy consequences, when those assertions come unaccompanied by a persuasive legal claim. among those appealing for the execution not to go ahead was the un high commissioner for human rights, who wrote directly to governor rick perry calling for his intervention. the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the un special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment also called on the authorities to stop the execution. governor perry refused to grant a reprieve. in his final statement before being killed by lethal injection, humberto leal expressed his remorse: i have hurt a lot of people. let this be final and be done. i take the full blame for this. i am sorry and forgive me, i am truly sorry. he was pronounced dead at 6.21pm local time. humberto leal was the 26th person to be executed in the usa this year, and the 1,260nd since judicial killing resumed in 1977. texas accounts for 471 of these executions, seven of which have been carried out this year. no further action is requested. many thanks to all who sent appeals. additional information mexico brought its vccr case against the usa in 2003, resulting in the icjs judgment in avena and other mexican nationals handed down on 31 march 2004. the usa has yet to comply with the avena judgment. on 28 february 2005, then-president george w. bush responded to the icj decision by seeking to have the state courts provide the necessary review and reconsideration in all of the affected cases. the texas court of criminal appeals later ruled that the president lacked the constitutional authority to order state court compliance and that the avena decision was not enforceable in the domestic courts. the case went to the us supreme court. on 25 march 2008, in medelln v. texas, the supreme court unanimously found that the avena decision constitutes an international law obligation on the part of the united states. the court also unanimously agreed that the reasons for complying with the icj judgment were plainly compelling, since its domestic enforcement would uphold united states interests in ensuring the reciprocal observance of the vienna convention, protecting relations with foreign governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of international law. however, a 6-3 majority ruled that the icjs decision is not automatically binding domestic law and that the authority for implementing it rested not with the president but with congress (see","update","2011-07-08",2,TRUE

http://www.amnesty-usa.org/urgact/ extra 182/99           death penalty    22 december 1999 usa (texas)     larry keith robison, aged 42 larry robison is scheduled to be executed in texas on 21 january 2000. he was sentenced to death for the murder of bruce gardner in 1982. several years before the murder he had been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. on 10 august 1982, junette bryant found the decapitated and mutilated body of her son ricky bryant at his home in fort worth, texas. next door, the police found the bodies of georgia reed and her 11-year-old son scott, as well as those of earline barker and bruce gardner. each of the victims had been shot in the head and their throats slit. georgia reed had also been stabbed numerous times. larry robison has never denied killing the five victims (although he was only tried for the murder of bruce gardner), but has maintained that the crime was the result of his mental illness. in a written account after the crime, he recalled how he had been called upon to liberate souls to ascend to a higher plane of existence, and described his hallucination that ricky bryant had urged him on even as he worked to sever his head from his body. larry robison described how a digital clock in the bathroom had flipped to a row of zeros and had then begun acting like a stop watch. he wrote that he had interpreted this as a message that he had to liberate as many souls as possible before the liberation of his own. larry robison was first convicted in 1983, but this conviction was reversed in 1986 by the texas court of criminal appeals because of an error during jury selection. at his retrial in 1987, he again pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity but again the jury rejected this plea, finding him guilty of capital murder. larry robison came within hours of execution on 17 august 1999. he was on his way to the lethal injection chamber when the court of criminal appeals issued a stay. his lawyers had filed a last-minute appeal on the grounds that he was mentally incompetent to be executed. after a hearing, however, a judge ruled on 15 november that he was competent to be executed. for further information about larry robisons crime, trial and illness, see time for humanitarian intervention: the imminent execution of larry robison (amr 51/107/99, july 1999). background information that larry robisons crime was of a very serious nature, and has caused immeasurable suffering, is not in question. his execution will not serve justice, however, but simply be the final act of a states failure to find an earlier, appropriate response to his mental illness. as the non-governmental us organization, the national alliance for the mentally ill, states: the death penalty is never appropriate for a defendant suffering from schizophrenia or other serious brain disorders. this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. the texas authorities will no doubt justify this human rights violation by arguing that two trial juries rejected larry robisons insanity plea, and that a judge found him competent to be executed. this does not alter the fact that larry robison had already been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia before he committed his crime, providing at the very least reasonable doubt of his legal sanity at the time of the killings. his case has generated much attention both inside and outside the usa, particularly as a result of the struggle of his mother, lois robison, who has campaigned tirelessly for his and other death sentences to be commuted and who had tried to get treatment for her son before he did anything violent (see document referred to above). amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases and believes that every death sentence is an affront to human dignity. each execution is a symptom of, not a solution to, the culture of violence. texas has accounted for 199 of the 598 executions nationwide since the usa resumed executions in 1977. it has consistently violated international human rights standards in its use of the death penalty. amnesty international is calling on governor bush to use his power to stop this execution as a genuine move away from his states appalling record on the death penalty. governor bush has overseen 112 executions in his five-year governorship. he is currently campaigning to become the republican partys candidate for us president under the slogan compassionate conservatism. in addition to the planned execution of larry robison, john penry, a severely mentally retarded man, is due to be executed in texas on 13 january (see extra 177/99, amr 51/210/99, 14 december 1999), and glen mcginnis on 25 january, for a crime committed when he was a child (see ua 320/99, amr 51/213/99, 16

physical abuse  whippings three to four times a week, including with extension cords  that williams was subjected to as a child by his father; his witnessing of the physical abuse of his mother by his stepfather; his fathers drug abuse and lewis williamss own resort to illegal drugs, including cocaine, by the age of 13, and lewis williamss low iq (at the age of 11, his iq was assessed as 76). the federal judge also wrote that if the trial lawyers had taken the time to obtain williamss school, juvenile, and treatment records, they would have discovered that his mother had sought psychological treatment for him at the age of 11. the boy had begun running away from home around the age of eight or nine. the jury heard extensive evidence that williams had been in trouble with the law as a juvenile, but were given none of the mitigating background that could help to explain it. the sixth circuit judge wrote that if the trial lawyers had investigated fully, they would have found evidence that the juvenile justice system had failed to meet his psychological and emotional needs. she concluded that: given the wealth of information that the attorneys could have presented regarding williams's troubled life, and the ease with which the attorneys could have obtained such information, it is difficult to imagine how the attorneys failure to conduct a proper investigation and then present meaningful mitigating evidence did not prejudice williams. as in this case, the strickland v washington decision has been a severe barrier to a successful appeal on the grounds of inadequate legal representation. since 1984, the supreme court has only overturned two death sentences on the basis of a violation of strickland . the first, williams v taylor , was in 2000, involving terry williams, a virginia death row inmate. in lewis williamss case the dissenting sixth circuit judge noted the similarity to the case of terry williams: like the six-justice majority in williams v taylor , i believe that a description of lewis williamss childhood, filled with sexual abuse and drug use and exposure to drugs at a young age, and parental neglect might well have influenced the jurys appraisal of williamss moral culpability. then, on 26 june 2003, in wiggins v smith , the supreme court overturned the death sentence of a maryland death row prisoner, kevin wiggins, on the basis that he had received inadequate legal representation. wigginss lawyers failed to investigate his social history and therefore, the court said, could not justify their decision not to present the compelling mitigating evidence that was available. the wiggins decision provides reason to hope for greater judicial scrutiny of the performances of capital trial lawyers. however, lewis williams remains scheduled for execution despite the similarities between his and the wiggins and williams cases in which those death sentences were overturned. international standards require that capital defendants receive such assistance at all stages of proceedings. the united nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has emphasized that all mitigating factors must be taken into account in capital cases. further recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in english or your own language, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of leoma chmielewski, explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of her death or to minimize the suffering it will have caused; - expressing concern that the jury heard minimal evidence of the defendant ;s dysfunctional and abusive background on which to base their sentencing decision; - noting that even without this information they evidently had trouble reaching a verdict, suggesting that the mitigating evidence that was available could have persuaded one or more jurors to vote for life; - noting that the federal district judge agreed that the trial lawyers had presented little (if any) relevant mitigating evidence to the jury, and that a sixth circuit judge has said that lewis williamss trial representation had been wholly inadequate at the sentencing phase; - noting the very high threshold for a successful appeal on inadequate legal representation, but that the us supreme court has recently indicated in wiggins v maryland greater judicial scrutiny of trial lawyers conduct, scrutiny that might have allowed lewis williams a successful appeal; - opposing the execution of lewis williams and urging clemency. appeals to: governor bob taft 30th floor 77 south high street columbus, ohio 43215-6117, usa","update","",3,TRUE

i want to live, and i am not living here. my struggle is not to die, but it is a struggle for the truth. background information around 460 men of 40 nationalities are detained without charge or trial at the us naval base at guantnamo bay, cuba. the hunger strike at the facility began when the camp authorities reportedly reneged on promises to accept detainees' demands, which included bringing the camp into compliance with the geneva conventions, made during an earlier hunger strike, in july 2005. towards the end of 2005, it emerged that a number of the detainees on the hunger strike had become seriously ill. they included fawzi al-odah who, by this time, had requested that the force-feeding be stopped so that he be allowed to die. around this time doctors warned his lawyers that despite the force-feeding fawzi al-odah was in imminent danger of death or permanent organ damage . amnesty international neither opposes nor recommends forcible feeding of prisoners on hunger strike. however, if forcible feeding is done in such a way as deliberately to cause suffering, amnesty international considers that this would constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. the un special rapporteur on torture has declared that if the reports about the force-feeding methods being used at guantnamo are true, then it would amount to cruel treatment. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing concern for the wellbeing of the detainees at guantnamo bay, and the fact that they are still unable to challenge the legality of their detention; - stating that detainees on hunger strike must not be forcibly fed in a manner that deliberately causes pain, and must not be subjected to torture or other ill-treatment; - calling on the us authorities to investigate all allegations that detainees on hunger strike have been subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and for all those responsible for such acts to be brought to justice;

""until or unless such a tribunal decides otherwise"", judge robertson wrote, ""hamdan has, and must be accorded, the full protections of a prisoner-of-war"". judge robertson dealt a blow to a central tenet of the us administrations ""war on terror"" detention policy  president bushs determination that the geneva conventions did not apply to alleged al-qaida suspects captured during the war in afghanistan, and that neither they nor taleban suspects were entitled to prisoner of war status. judge robertson concluded that ""[n]otwithstanding the presidents view ... the third geneva convention applies to all persons detained in afghanistan during the hostilities there."" he noted that ""[t]he president is not a tribunal"", and also pointed out that the combatant status review tribunals (csrts), set up by the administration following the us supreme courts decision in june 2004 that the federal courts have jurisdiction over the guantnamo detainees, did not constitute the ""competent tribunals"" required by the third geneva convention. as a presumed prisoner of war, judge robertson said, salim ahmed hamdan was due the same standard of justice as would be provided us soldiers, in other words, a court-martial under the ucmj. article 102 of the third geneva convention states that ""a prisoner of war can be validly sentenced only if the sentence has been pronounced by the same courts according to the same procedure as in the case of member of the armed forces of the detaining power"". judge robertson said that the ""military commission is not such a court. its procedures are not such procedures."" judge robertson held that even if salim ahmed hamdan was found not to have prisoner of war status by a ""competent tribunal"" which satisfied the requirements of the third geneva convention, given the current military commission rules permitting the exclusion of the defendant from certain sessions and the withholding of certain classified or ""protected"" evidence from him, his trial before the military commission would be unlawful. judge robertson stressed his concern that under the commission rules ""the accused himself may be excluded from proceedings"" and ""evidence may be adduced that he will never see (because his [military] lawyer will be forbidden to disclose it to him)"". it is ""obvious"", judge robertson wrote, that such a ""dramatic deviation"" from us constitutional law ""could not be countenanced in any american court"", including a court-martial under the ucmj. the judge also pointed out that the right to be tried ""in ones presence"" is a principle of international humanitarian and human rights law. since december 2003, salim ahmed hamdan had been held in pre-trial isolation in camp echo in guantnamo bay, in what amnesty international considers to have been cruel and inhuman conditions of detention with potentially serious psychological consequences. just before the oral arguments held in judge robertsons court on 25 october 2004, the government advised that it had moved salim ahmed hamdan out of camp echo and back into a segregation wing of camp delta. judge robertson noted this change in circumstances, and that the government was ""capable of repeating"" the camp echo isolation regime ""which has evaded review"". however, he pointed out that the fact that the government might resort to repetition of such treatment in the future was not something that he could review in the context of the current habeas corpus proceedings. he did order, however, that salim ahmed hamdan ""must be released from the pre-commission detention wing of camp delta and returned to the general population of detainees, unless some other than the pending charges against him requires different treatment"". amnesty international has been informed that david hicks, ali hamza ahmed sulayman al bahlul, ibrahim ahmed mahmoud al qosi, and uk nationals moazzam begg and feroz abbasi, who were moved to camp echo some time after they had been made eligible for trial by military commission in july 2003, have also now been moved out of camp echo and to a segregation wing of camp delta. the us administration is seeking an emergency stay of judge robertsons decision and has said it will immediately appeal it. amnesty international encourages the us administration, despite its immediate negative reaction to the ruling, to recognize it as another sign of the serious concern, national and international, about the military commissions and to abandon such trials once and for all. the organization also continues to campaign for all guantnamo detainees to be brought to trial in full accordance with international fair trial standards, without resort to the death penalty, or else released. for further information, please see the following amnesty international","update","2003-07-08",8,TRUE

section 101 would also increase the burden of proof for some asylum applicants by allowing judges to require supplemental evidence, and to deny asylum if it isnt provided. obtaining such evidence can be difficult for refugees who often flee without their belongings, and who are often put into detention after they arrive here. finally, asking their family or friends back home to collect the evidence often puts those friends and family in danger. this section also restricts higher courts ability to reverse an immigration judges demand for such corroborating evidence. section 101 would also introduce new credibility grounds for denying asylum. an applicants demeanor (among other highly subjective factors) could become the determining factor in assessing credibility. it would also allow asylum to be denied for lack of consistency with any statement the applicant made at any time to any u.s. official, including any inaccuracies. this would permit a judge to deny asylum based on minor inconsistencies that are not even pertinent to the asylum claim. since asylum-seekers often find themselves forced to use false documents to escape their countries, it is unreasonable to use an applicants first statement to any u.s. official to impeach his or her sworn testimony - no matter how well supported. sec. 103/104 proposes a broad definition of terrorism as grounds for deportability section 103 also creates an unreasonably high standard on immigrants to prove by clear and convincing evidence that they did not know that an organization with which they had some association was involved in  terrorist activities, broadly defined. this is virtually impossible because it would require a person to prove what they did not know. the definition of terrorist organizations includes a group of two or more, whether organized or not or a subgroup of such a group that is involved in vaguely defined terrorist activities. for example, if an immigrant donated money to help tsunami victims, to a charity that was part of an organization that had a subgroup involved in rebellion against the indonesian government, the donor could become deported for aiding terrorists - unless he or she could prove by clear and convincing evidence that he or she didnt know of the link. section 103 penalizes people for espousing or endorsing terrorist activity, again, so broadly defined that it could refer to what the founding fathers did - calling for the armed overthrow of an oppressive regime. this broad language extends beyond conduct and has the potential to infringe on a persons freedom of speech. to verbally endorse an activity is currently well permitted in the constitution of the united states. the bill in its current form imposes dangerous penalties on freedom of speech in this country. section 103 also makes no allowance for innocent people who are often forced by rebel groups to provide them support, such as shelter or transportation. fearing for their safety, these individuals flee to the united states for protection from such threats and extortion. under this bill, they would be denied asylum for the same reason for which they are seeking it. suggested action please write, call and fax your representatives as soon as possible explaining amnesty internationals concerns regarding these provisions of h.r. 418, and ask them to vote against the bill. appeals to call your representative through the capitol hill switchboard at 202-225-3121 or send a letter by fax. to find your representatives phone and fax numbers, visit","","",2,TRUE

- stating that despite this, rais khan azeezkhan pathan is continuing to receive death threats; - urging the state government to ensure that all three human rights defenders and witnesses in the forthcoming trial continue to receive police protection, especially in light of these threats; - calling on the government of india to order an independent and impartial investigation into allegations that human rights defenders have received threats and to take prompt action against anyone found to have threatened them;

refused to intervene in the case of ahmed belbacha, an algerian national in us custody in guantnamo bay who is feared to be in imminent danger of forcible return to algeria, where he would be at risk of secret detention and torture. the supreme court denied his appeal for an injunction against his repatriation, without comment. ahmed belbacha, who has been held without charge or trial in guantnamo since february 2002 after being taken into custody in pakistan in december 2001, previously lived in the united kingdom, where he sought asylum on the grounds that in algeria he had faced persecution from an armed opposition group. ahmed belbachas safety has been further jeopardized by the us governments labeling of him as an enemy combatant and the stigma that attaches to guantnamo detainees, whom the us authorities have collectively and repeatedly labeled terrorists. anyone suspected of involvement in terrorist activities, or who is believed to possess information about terrorist activities in algeria or abroad, faces a real risk of secret detention and torture at the hands of algerian military intelligence agency the department for information and security (dpartement du renseignement et de la scurit, drs). amnesty international has received dozens of reports of detainees treated in this way, among them people who had returned to algeria from overseas, either voluntarily or at the hands of foreign governments. in 2006, the un human rights committee urged the usa to ""take all necessary measures"" to ensure that it transferred no-one to another country ""if there are substantial reasons for believing that they would be in danger of being subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."" in its report to the un committee against torture in 2006, the usa stated that it does not transfer people to countries where it believes it is ""more likely than not that they will be tortured"", a lesser standard than international law requires. the usa, the report continued, ""obtains assurances, as appropriate, from the foreign government to which a detainee is transferred that it will not torture the individual being transferred"". amnesty international opposes reliance on ""diplomatic assurances"" as a basis for sending anyone to countries where forcible return would expose them to a real risk of torture or other ill-treatment. such assurances are unreliable and unenforceable. amnesty international understands that the us authorities have been attempting to obtain assurances from the algerian authorities about the treatment of returnees, but the organization does not know what assurances, if any, they have obtained. in early july, algerian foreign minister mourad medelci expressed strong reservations about the us governments proposed conditions for handing over algerian detainees held in guantnamo. in any event, amnesty international reiterates that, irrespective of any assurances that are obtained from the algerian authorities, ahmed belbacha or any other algerian nationals held in guantnamo must not be forcibly returned to their country of origin. on 7 august, in a change of policy, the uk government announced that it had decided to request the release from guantnamo and return to the uk of five detainees who were legally resident here prior to their detention. however, ahmed belbacha was not among them. the uk authorities revealed that they had written to the us secretary of state requesting the release of shaker aamer, jamil el banna, omar deghayes, binyam mohamed and abdennour sameur, who had been granted refugee status, indefinite leave or exceptional leave to remain in the uk prior to being taken into us custody. it appears that the uk government did not include ahmed belbacha in its request to the us authorities because it understood that he was not legally resident in the uk prior to his detention. his lawyers believe that he was legally in the uk with leave to remain while final resolution of his asylum application was pending. a judge dismissed his appeal in 2002 when ahmed belbacha failed to appear at the hearing. the reason for his non-appearance was that he was in us custody. in its announcement on 7 august, the uk government said that previously the us had made clear that they did not intend to negotiate with third countries regarding non-nationals. we judged that it would also have been counter-productive, at that time, to our wider aim of securing closure of the detention facility. because the situation has now changed, the uk government changed its policy in relation to the former residents. on 9 august, president bush said that part of the delay in the usas failure to close the guantnamo detention facility is the reluctance of some nations to take back some of the people being held there. in other words, in order to make it work, we've got to have a place for these people to go. amnesty international has no further information on other algerian nationals at risk of forcible transfer from guantnamo to algeria. recommended action: please send appeals to the us authorities to   arrive as quickly as possible: - calling on the us authorities not to forcibly return to algeria ahmed belbacha or any other algerian nationals held in guantnamo; - expressing concern that ahmed belbachas safety would be at serious risk if he was returned to algeria; - noting that diplomatic assurances are inherently unreliable and unenforceable, and should not be relied upon by the us authorities in such cases.

extrajudicial execution pakistan        targeted killings of health professionals in mid-march 2002 when an amnesty international delegation reached karachi, the largest city in pakistan, three doctors from the shia minority community 1 had been shot dead, three had survived attempts on their lives and seven had reportedly migrated within the previous week. several doctors who amnesty international spoke to had closed their clinics and sent their families abroad. one doctor said to amnesty international, it is better to stop earning than to stop living. the targeting of doctors from the small shia minority community on the grounds of religion or cultural identity is not a new phenomenon in pakistan. however, since pakistan declared its support for the us-led coalition against terrorism, there has been a further in systematic killings of members of the shia community (including doctors), christians and westerners unconnected with sectarian strife. some of the christians targeted have included nurses working in a christian hospital. the fact that they were nurses may not have been the reason for the attack on them, whereas the doctors are clearly targeted due to their double identity as members of the shia minority community and their profession. the perpetrators of these killings are believed to be islamists 2. the government of pakistan 3 has on several occasions condemned sectarian violence. amnesty international believes, however, that the government has systematically failed to exercise due diligence when it failed to prevent abuses against specific religious communities, to investigate such abuses and to punish the perpetrators. reasons for targeted killings of shia doctors the pakistan medical association (pma) stated in march 2002 that more than 70 doctors had been murdered in karachi during the past 10 years, the majority of whom were from the shia community. shia make up between five and 10 per cent of the population of pakistan, christians some three to five per cent whereas sunnis comprise around 85 per cent of the population. relatives of shia victims have told amnesty international that they believe that sunni militant organizations target community leaders and admired role models in order to debilitate the community by making it leaderless and drive its members out of the country or discourage those already abroad from returning to pakistan. members of the shia community have told amnesty international that the community has many educated members. the decimation of the most educated elite of this minority community deeply impacts on its sense of security. relatives of shia doctors have pointed out to amnesty international again and again how easy it is to target doctors, particularly shia doctors, many of whom are well known and have a distinct profile for professional achievement and social commitments. many provide free medical assistance not only to their shia co-religionists but to society at large. their name boards outside their clinics give them away, their working hours are regular and they must keep themselves accessible to the public. many specialist doctors in karachi who typically have teaching assignments in medical colleges in the morning, hospital duties in the afternoon and their private practice in the evenings, have tried to vary their routines. some have reduced or stopped their evening practices; others have changed their cars or hired private guards. political analysts in pakistan told amnesty international that the killing of shia doctors and other shia professionals appeared to be part of the motive of militant sectarian groups to send a signal that they would not tolerate government attempts to curtail their activities. cases of killings and attempted killings the citizen police liaison committee listed eight doctors killed in 2000 and seven killed in 2001. one of the doctors killed in 2001 was dr raza jafri (39), who was shot dead on 31 may 2001 as he was leaving his clinic in karachi. a bearded man in his 30s reportedly asked staff for the whereabouts of dr. jafri, went straight up to him, took out a pistol and shot him dead. dr. jafri died on the spot. according to his family, dr jafri had no personal enemies and had not received an indication that he might be targeted. most of his welfare activities, which included financial support for needy people, benefited members of both the shia and sunni communities. in 2002 the following shia doctors have been killed, but other deaths may have gone unreported: -- on 4 february, dr. fayyaz karim, a dermatologist, was shot dead at khawaja ajmer nagri, karachi; -- on 12 february, dr. syed rashid mehdi was shot dead in karachi; -- on 4 march, dr. alay safdar zaidi was shot dead in karachi; -- on 7 march, dr. manzoor ahmed sumoo was shot dead in karachi; -- on 9 march, dr. yousuf ghori was shot dead in karachi. dr. alay safdar zaidi (42), was shot dead on 4 march 2002 when his car stopped at a traffic light in the centre of karachi on his way to work. two men on a motorbike drew up and opened fire. dr. zaidi had no political connections, no religious office and no personal enemies. one of three highly qualified nephrologists in karachi, dr. zaidi had some eight months earlier returned to pakistan after an 11-year stay in the usa. he was committed to improving medical care in pakistan and making it affordable for poorer sections of society. he was working to introduce cheap dialysis methods and had plans to open a new kidney centre in karachi. dr zaidi had received threatening phone calls in october 2001 and as a precaution had begun to change his daily route. in karachi, the amnesty international delegation also met a the widow of dr. syed rashid mehdi (39), a chest physician. on 12 february 2002, at 10.30 p.m. on his way home from his practice, he was shot three times in the head from close range as he sat in his car next to a pharmacy where he had stopped. he died immediately. he was not involved in any religious or political activities but had throughout his life focussed on his studies and professional development. there had been no threats or any other incidents that could have alerted him to the danger to his life. some doctors have escaped attacks on their lives, some badly injured. dr. jafer naqvi , a 60-year-old kidney specialist escaped in march 2002 when two men on a motorbike closed in on him in karachi. as the car was fired at, it swerved and. dr. naqvi and two doctors accompanying him jumped out and hid in a private house. the presence of a police mobile van in the area may have led to the attackers fleeing. another doctor, dr. syed mujavir ali rizvi, was the target of shootings twice and is now confined to a wheelchair. dr. rizvi and his wife, dr. goher sultana, also a medical doctor, set up a clinic in karachi in 1983 where a year later, on 16 june 1984, he was shot at by several islamists. a bullet injured his spinal chord leaving him paralysed. after one and a half years of physiotherapy, he succeeded in moving about in a wheelchair and, with the encouragement of his wife, returned to his practice in 1995. on 30 january 2002, islamists shot him once again as his wife was about to drive him home from the clinic. still partly paralyzed from the first attack, he was an easy target and sustained several bullet injuries. dr. rizvi survived this attack as well but has one bullet still lodged in his shoulder. since then dr. rizvi, his wife and their three children have mostly stayed at home as they are afraid of further attacks. the family was not given police protection at any stage despite repeated attacks on their lives and death threats. five nurses were also killed on the basis of their religion. on 9 august 2002 in taxila, punjab province, three men threw hand grenades at members of the christian congregation as they emerged from the chapel of the presbyterian missionary hospital after morning prayers. five pakistani nurses and one of the attackers were killed and at least 25 others were injured. some non-shia doctors have also been killed, either deliberately in a revenge action or when they were mistaken for shias. the targeted killing of dr. anwarul islam, a sunni, occurred after four shia doctors had been killed in targeted shootings in karachi shortly before. on 13 march 2002, anwarul islam, an ear, nose and throat specialist, was killed by motorcyclists in karachi as he left his clinic in the city centre in the evening. dr ishrat hussain, a sunni, was killed on 8 july 2002, apparently because his name was mistaken for a shi a name. impact on health care provision given that there are about 7,000 doctors for karachis population of 14 million, resulting in one general practitioner for every 2,000 people and one specialist for 230,000 persons and that it takes about 15 years to train a specialist,4 it becomes evident that the attacks, killings of doctors and their flight from karachi bear a high social and economic cost. while those who target doctors on sectarian grounds abuse a range of rights of their victims, including the rights to life and security of the person as well as the right to work without risk and interference, they also abuse the right to health of large sections of society. doctors of the pma have also pointed out that the loss of professors of medicine in punjab was a difficult setback for the profession. protest of pakistan medical association outrage at the targeted killings of shia doctors has been widely shared in pakistan. on 22 march 2002, the pma went on a one day strike to protest against what they saw as the governments indifference to the fate of doctors, particularly shia doctors in karachi and all major government and private hospitals closed all but emergency facilities. in response the government agreed to issue firearms licences to doctors. a further strike was held on 8 april 2002. the pma said on that occasion that the government could soon find the country deprived of doctors, particularly specialists. a joint action committee involving representatives of several human rights organisations on 16 march 2002 passed a resolution which it sent to the government; the resolution says inter alia : targeted killings on the basis of religion should be condemned without reservation. of particular concern is the trend towards killing medical professionals. we demand that the government firmly control the menace and re-establish the rule of law. for further information

n   urging the authorities to conduct a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into the allegations that defendants were beaten in detention; and ensure the men receive an independent medical examination, n   urging the authorities to take immediate action to ensure that trials relating to the june violence are conducted in an orderly, fair and transparent manner. appeals to: osh oblast prosecutor's office prosecutor marat alymbekov 162a, k.datki street osh 714018, kyrgyzstan","","",2,TRUE

qedimi (m), aged about 32 muslim cleric hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi was released from tabriz prison on 31 august 2006. he had served approximately five months of his one-year prison sentence. upon his release, hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi thanked amnesty international and its members for their concern and help. according to reports, his release was ordered by the special court for the clergy. it is believed that the release is conditional and the authorities have stipulated that if he resumes his activities on behalf of the iranian azerbaijani community he will be re-detained in order to serve the remainder of his sentence, and will face new charges. he is also banned from taking up employment. in january 2006 hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi was tried by branch five of the special court for the clergy in tabriz under articles 19, 20, 48 and 500 of the penal code, article 42 of the code of criminal procedures and articles 42 and 48 of the special code for the clergy. his trial was held in a closed session (in violation of article 14 (1) of the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr), to which iran is a state party), and he did not have access to a lawyer of his choosing (in violation of article 14 (3) (b) of the iccpr) and therefore attended his trial without legal representation. the judge acted as both prosecutor and judge, in violation of international standards on the independence of the judiciary. according to hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi, unusually for cases in azeri areas, the judge was not an azeri turkish speaker and insisted on conducting the proceedings in farsi, a language in which hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi did not feel comfortable defending himself. he has also said that he was not provided with any court documents during his trial, except for the final verdict. the court convicted hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi of propagandizing in favor of groups and organizations against the system under article 500 of the penal code, and sentenced him to one year's imprisonment. he received the additional punishments of five years exile from all azerbaijani provinces in iran, and a five year overseas travel ban under articles 19 and 20 of the penal code. these restrictions are in direct contravention of the right to freedom of movement both within ones country and freedom to leave any country, as set out in article 12 (1) and (2) of the iccpr. he was also banned from wearing the clothes of a religious scholar for 10 years for bringing the clergy into disrepute. this ban is also in contravention of his freedom to manifest his religion, as set out in article 18 of the iccpr. an appeal against his sentence was rejected on 20 february 2006 by branch two of the special court for the clergy. this court, acting as an appeal court, additionally convicted him of the charges of pan-turkic activities and acting with pan-turkic opposition groups. hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi has stated that he does not believe in the use of violence and is committed to peaceful means of activism on behalf of the iranian azerbaijani community. amnesty international believes that the conviction of hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi on the charge of propagandizing in favor of groups and organizations against the system is in violation of his rights to freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of peaceful assembly, and non-discrimination. these rights are guaranteed in articles 19, 21, and 26 of the iccpr. politically-motivated prosecutions of the iranian azerbaijani community for peacefully asserting their rights also infringe their rights as a minority group as guaranteed by article 27 of the iccpr. if hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi were re-detained, amnesty international would consider him to be a prisoner of conscience, held solely on account of his belief in non-violent protest and peaceful activities on behalf of the iranian azerbaijani community in iran. amnesty international calls for his release to be unconditional and for all restrictions on him to be lifted. hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi was in poor health during his detention in the military and government section of tabriz prison. he suffered from dental problems, and was permitted a 20-day leave period to receive treatment in may 2006, and a further period of temporary leave in july 2006. hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi also developed a sinus infection, for which he was denied medial treatment in prison. as a result, the infection has worsened to the extent that he now suffers from dizziness, nausea, and is unable to stand up. his health is said to be very poor. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - welcoming hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimis release from prison, but expressing concern at reports that the release is conditional, and that if hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi continues his peaceful activities on behalf of the iranian azerbaijani community he will be re-detained and may face new charges; - stating that amnesty international considers hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimis conviction on the charge of propagandizing in favor of groups and organizations against the system is in violation of his rights to freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of peaceful assembly, and non-discrimination. these rights are guaranteed in articles 19, 21, and 26 of the international covenant of civil and political rights (iccpr), to which iran is a state party; - stating that, as such, if hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi is re-detained, amnesty international would consider him to be a prisoner of conscience who should be released immediately and unconditionally; - calling for the removal of the restrictions and bans against hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimi, including a ban on foreign travel and on traveling to azerbaijani provinces within iran, which are in violation of his right to freedom of movement; - calling for the removal of the imposed ban on hojjatoleslam ezimi qedimis right to wear the clothes of a religious scholar, in violation of the freedom to manifest his religion; - urging the iranian authorities to review the use of special courts such as the special court for the clergy; - noting that the laws and practices of such courts do not conform to international standards for fair trial, and calling for them to be either reformed in order to meet these standards, or else abolished, as they are currently inherently incapable of providing the basic guarantees of due process which are any defendants fundamental right. appeals to: leader of the islamic republic: his excellency ayatollah sayed ali

however analysts refer to the situation on the ground as an undeclared war. over two decades of conflict in sri lanka have claimed the lives of more than 65,000 people, the majority of them civilians. there are fears that a pattern of ""disappearances"" by state agents is re-emerging in sri lanka following the introduction of new emergency regulations in august 2005 that granted sweeping powers to the security forces. sixty-two cases of ""disappearance"" in the north of the country have been registered by the human rights commission of sri lanka over the past year. the commission is also investigating the status of 183 other individuals who are still missing under unknown circumstances. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing concern at an eyewitness statement alleging that rev. fr. thiruchchelvan nihal jim brown and wenceslaus vinces vimalathas were followed by armed men on 20 august, and that some of these men were later seen speaking to sln personnel; - noting that this latest eyewitness statement, combined with a lack of evidence of the two men's return from allaipiddy on the day they went missing, heightens fears that they have ""disappeared""; - urging the authorities to conduct an independent and impartial investigation into the fate and whereabouts of rev. fr. thiruchchelvan nihal jim brown and wenceslaus vinces vimalathas and to make the findings public; - calling upon the authorities, if the two men are found to be in custody, to allow them access to their relatives, a lawyer and any medical treatment they may require, and urging that they be immediately and unconditionally released unless they are to be charged with a recognizably criminal offence;

(see ua 257/01, mde 12/028/2001, 12 october 2001) in the case of sweden, two egyptians were forcibly returned to egypt, where they faced serious risk of human rights violations, on 18 december 2001 following an unfair procedure. both men were held for more than one month in incommunicado detention without contact with lawyers or relatives. on 23 january 2002 officials of the swedish embassy to egypt visited the two men for the first time since their deportation. the same day, the relatives of one of the detainees were allowed a prison visit. until today, no investigations into allegations of torture and ill-treatment are known to have been carried out in egypt. (ua 324/01 issued 19 december 2001) recommended action: please send appeals as quickly as possible: - expressing concern at reports that muhammad zeki muhammad mahjoub is at imminent risk of being forcibly returned to egypt, and calling for all attempts to return him to be halted; - urging the canadian authorities to end the forcible return of any person to a country where they are at risk of serious human rights abuses, in accordance with canadas international obligations, including the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees and the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and under customary international law; - reminding the canadian authorities that, regardless of any suspicion they have against muhammad zeki muhammad mahjoub, international law provides that the prohibition on the forcible return of anyone to a country, where there are substantial reasons to believe they are at risk of torture, is absolute; -urging the canadian government to consider launching appropriate criminal proceedings in canada if there is evidence that muhammad zeki muhammad mahjoub may have committed serious human rights violations or acts of  terrorism - urging the canadian authorities not to send muhammad zeki muhammad mahjoub to any third country where he would not be granted effective and durable protection against forcible return to egypt. appeals to: prime minister the right hon.jean joseph jaques chretien p.c., m.p. langevin block ottawa, canada, on k1a oa2","","2001-12-19",2,TRUE

of those arrested, adults were first held in police custody (garde  vue) and in most cases transferred to immigration detention centers around france; unaccompanied minors were taken to special accommodation centers (centres daccueil spcialiss). most of those arrested were afghan nationals. irregular migrants (those with no legal right to remain) in france may be put in administrative detention (rtention administrative) pending deportation. those still detained following the police operation may face barriers to their ability to challenge individually the decision to deport, access to competent interpretation services and legal counsel, and access to a review, ideally a judicial review, of a negative decision. in some cases where irregular migrants want to ask for asylum, their claim is examined under the accelerated priority procedure, which severely limits the right to appeal while still in the country. forcible returns could possibly take place to greece and italy, under the dublin ii procedure, which permits eu member states to return asylum-seekers to another eu member state which has accepted responsibility for processing the asylum claim. amnesty international and other organizations, including the un high commissioner for refugees (unhcr), have urged all eu member states to refrain from transferring asylum-seekers back to greece under the dublin ii procedure. on 17 june the french immigration minister insisted that the authorities would seek to forcibly return a number of migrants and asylum-seekers to greece, despite a decision by the european court of human rights which found that a turkish asylum-seeker had been subjected to ill-treatment in greece. on 24 september, the immigration minister confirmed that a number of forcible returns would soon take place. amnesty international is monitoring the situation of migrants and asylum-seekers in greece and has campaigned against the forcible return of migrants and asylum-seekers from france to greece under the dublin ii procedure. amnesty international has monitored the situation of migrants and asylum-seekers in the area surrounding calais, and has contributed towards research published in september 2008 by an ngo coalition la coordination franaise pour le droit dasile (cfda). the research is available in french at","update","",3,TRUE

for example, the government response to the urgent action letter-writer asserts that, ""[t]here are no political prisoners in the maldives. none of the detainees listed in your letter were arrested for political activities."" however, the government has not produced any credible evidence to support this claim. meanwhile, amnesty international's information strongly indicates that those in detention were peaceful protestors, who were advocating political reform. at least three of those detained, fathimath nisreen, mohamed zaki and ahmed ibrahim didi, are known to be prisoners of conscience, imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression. another of those in detention, mohamed mahir, has reportedly been exiled once and detained several times after writing a poem in 1986 perceived as being critical of the government. at least three other people who were arrested after the demonstrations are being held under house arrest, while others who have since been released have been told that they must not leave the country. in the last three days there have been reports of two more arrests of opposition political activists by the government. these include the reported arrest of ismail asif from his home on 17 september, where he was reportedly involved in organising an informal meeting of hundreds of people to discuss democratic reforms. the names of others in detention are known to include fathimath nisreen (f);

former child refugee, precise age unknown samnang prim is facing trial in colorado for the murder of james roberts in 1998. on 5 april 2002, the prosecutor must state in court whether he will seek the death penalty against samnang prim. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally in every case. the organization also seeks to ensure that international law and safeguards on the death penalty are fully recognized in the diminishing number of countries that still use it. its particular concern in this case relates to the possibility that samnang prim, who was born on an unknown date to a cambodian mother in a refugee camp in thailand, was under 18 years old at the time of the crime for which he has been charged. if he was indeed under 18, the prosecution is precluded not only by colorado law from seeking a death sentence, but also by international law. the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) and the convention on the rights of the child prohibit the use of the death penalty against anyone who was under 18 at the time of the crime. amnesty international believes that before the state of colorado can legally seek the death penalty against samnang prim, it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had reached 18 years old at the time of the murder for which he has been indicted. based on its human rights work during and arising from the period 1975-1979 in cambodia, amnesty international believes that there are well-founded reasons to believe that samnang prim may well have been under 18 at the time the murder of which he is accused (see below). in addition, amnesty international has received information indicating that samnang prim suffers from significant frontal lobe brain dysfunction. the use of the death penalty against the mentally impaired contradicts international safeguards. the united nations commission on human rights has repeatedly adopted resolutions calling on retentionist countries not to impose or carry out the death penalty on anyone suffering from any form of mental disorder. background information the murder of james e. roberts occurred in denver on 7 november 1998. samnang prims date of birth has been given as 16 september 1980, but there is no record of his birth and this appears to have been a date that was assigned to him by officials in thailand. if this date is correct, samnang prim was approximately eight weeks past his 18th birthday at the time of the crime. however, given samnang prims background there are good reasons to believe that he may, in fact, be younger than his listed age. in cambodian culture, the exact date of birth is not considered to be important. parents may remember the astrological year in which their child was born (for example, the year of the snake, or the year of the rooster), or sometimes the season (for example, it was before the khmer new year, it was after the rainy season), but the exact date is not seen as an important part of a childs history. in addition, cambodians tend to add a year to their childs age, in that they would normally say that a newborn child was one year old. this is quite common in other southeast asian countries also. in the specific circumstances of the refugee camps on the thai-cambodian border in 1979 and the early 1980s, a number of facts should be noted. in the first place, the population of these camps was made up of deeply traumatized people, who had suffered greatly both during the 1975 - 1979 khmer rouge government, but also during the preceding five years of war. for most people in the camps, this was their first exposure to western norms of personal registration. many found this a confusing and difficult experience, and for this and other reasons were unable to provide any accurate answers to questions. secondly, many children born in that era were the product of forced marriages during the khmer rouge period, and the women who bore these children were suffering deep emotional distress, as well as severe physical privations. they would not have known the birth dates of their children, and they would in all probability have added to each childs age, partly for the cultural reasons outlined above, and partly because food rations were based on physical needs, and older children were allocated more food. as the majority of the camp populations had been near to starvation on arrival in the camps, there was an overwhelming desire to ensure food security for themselves and their families. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of james roberts, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of his death or comment on the guilt or innocence of the accused; - expressing unconditional opposition to the use of the death penalty, pointing out that it is a punishment that is used in a minority of countries and its use in the usa is causing serious damage to the international reputation of the united states; - pointing out that international and colorado law prohibits the use of the death penalty against defendants who were under 18 at the time of the crime, and arguing that the prosecutor should respect the spirit of this law by announcing that he will not pursue the death penalty because of the possibility that samnang prim was under 18 at the time of the crime; - noting evidence that samnang prim may suffer significant mental impairment, noting the international communitys opposition to the imposition of the death penalty against anyone suffering from such impairment. appeals to: bill ritter, jr. district attorney, 2nd judicial district 303 west colfax, suite 1300 denver, co 80204","","",2,TRUE

- pointing out that by issuing the execution warrant, the government has violated the ruling of the judicial committee of the privy council in the case of darrin roger thomas and haniff hillaire to stay executions until petitions are finally disposed of by the inter-american commission on human rights and the inter-american court on human rights; - pointing out that the execution warrant also violates the order of the inter-american court on human rights to take measures to preserve his life until such time as the court issues a decision on the matter;

the european union, the european parliament, and the secretary general of the council of europe; former fbi director william sessions, and former and current members of us congress bob barr, carol moseley braun and john lewis. international standards prohibit the execution of anyone whose guilt is in doubt. amnesty international opposes troy daviss execution unconditionally, regardless of questions of guilt or innocence, as it does all use of the death penalty. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 1,122 prisoners have been put to death, 43 of them in georgia. in the same period, more than 100 people have been released from death rows around the country on grounds of innocence, many of them in cases in which witness testimony has been shown to have been unreliable. several prisoners have gone to their deaths despite doubts about their guilt. for a full report on this case, see usa: where is the justice for me? the case of troy davis, facing execution in georgia, february 2007,","update","",3,TRUE

were killed in israel and hundreds of others were wounded within the first few days. in the first week of the conflict there were more than 2,400 casualties in gaza and the west bank, including 59 deaths. on some occasions in the west bank and gaza, members of the palestinian security forces or others fired on the israeli security forces. palestinians and israelis have also both been the victims of serious human rights abuses, including killings, by private individuals. on 12 october an angry palestinian crowd killed two israeli reservists in the custody of  the palestinian police. this was followed by reprisal bombings on palestinian authority facilities in various palestinian towns in the west bank and gaza strip which injured about 30 people. since then, violence has continued and to date more than 230 [to 15 november] people have been killed according to press and ngo figures. at least 8000 [to 15 november] have been wounded. the vast majority of the people who have died or been injured throughout the period of the conflict are palestinians and at least 43 have been reported to be aged 17 or under. following initial investigations conducted by amnesty international delegates in israel and the occupied territories, including the areas under the jurisdiction of the palestinian authority (pa), the organization concluded that many deaths were due to the use of excessive force by israeli security forces and that no attempt was made to investigate these deaths. in addition amnesty international has documented and condemned alleged killings and ill-treatment of palestinians by israelis and alleged killings and ill-treatment of israelis by palestinians. also of great concern to amnesty international is the disruption of medical services to the wounded by road blocks and the closure of borders, as well numerous well-documented attacks on medical vehicles and personnel, including the fatal shooting of three clearly identified paramedics. ai is calling on all parties to respect the geneva convention standards, including respect for medical neutrality. killings no systematic official inquiry into deaths during the current conflict has taken place. the most detailed analysis of injury patterns and causes of death available to ai has been made by the us organization physicians for human rights (phr). their analysis drew on hospital records and interviews in israel, the occupied territories and the palestinian authority, gathered during a mission 20-27 october 2000. of those killed in gaza between 30 september and 24 october, more than one third (12/31) were aged under 18. in half the cases, palestinians had been shot with high velocity weapons. nearly half the victims were shot in the head. others were hit by rubber bullets. wael m emad, aged 12, was killed when hit in the forehead by a rubber coated steel bullet at erez crossing on 21 october 2000. international humanitarian law the fourth geneva convention of 12 august 1949 protects civilians living in territory occupied by another power. along with the other three geneva conventions, it was ratified by israel in 1951. israel occupied the west bank and gaza strip in the course of a war with syria, egypt and jordan in 1967 but has stated that it does not regard the fourth geneva convention as applicable under international law to these territories, although it has repeatedly affirmed that israel would respect in practice its 'humanitarian provisions'. the international committee of the red cross and the united nations have consistently maintained that the convention fully applies de jure to the occupied territories and that the palestinians are a protected population under the terms of the fourth geneva convention.  many killings have occurred when soldiers have fired on children and youths throwing stones. one case reported by amnesty international occurred on 10 october when amnesty international delegates witnessed the aftermath of a demonstration in rafah on the southern edge of the gaza strip. sami fathi abu jazzar was declared brain dead after being wounded in the head when israeli soldiers shot at a crowd of some 400 people, mostly young elementary schoolchildren, throwing stones at an israeli military post. six others were injured. the children had been encouraged by older youths to leave their schools and to go and demonstrate. the delegates concluded that the lives of israeli soldiers, whose position was heavily fortified and located far away from the stone throwers behind two wire fences, were in no danger  from the stone throwers and there was no justification for the use of lethal force.  sami abu jazzar died the following day, on the eve of his 12th birthday. disruption of health care services health care services in israel and the occupied territories have been disrupted by attacks on health personnel, by impeding access to hospitals of patients and health personnel; and by blocking the movement of medical supplies and of the injured trying to leave to receive treatment abroad. attacks on identifiable health personnel and ambulances the geneva conventions confer protection on medical and paramedical staff who are clearly identified as such and who are undertaking medical tasks only. nevertheless there have been several reports of attacks on medical and paramedical personnel during the conflict. bassam fayez al-bilbaisi, aged 45, an emergency medical technician for the palestine red crescent society and ambulance driver from gaza city, was killed on 30 september while attempting to rescue muhammad al-dura and his father (see above p.1). a second ambulance driver was also shot at. mr al-bilbaisi left a wife and nine children. in the first week of the current conflict, law, the palestinian society for the protection of human rights & the environment, reported the deaths of two palestinian paramedics, amjad daraghmi and mahir 'abid, both 22 years old. both were visibly identified as paramedics according to law. on 6 october 2000, the international committee of the red cross and the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies expressed their concern about the escalating conflict in the territories and ""strongly condemn[ed] the disregard for and attacks on medical personnel, as dozens of ambulances from the palestine red crescent society (prcs) and the magen david adom (mda) [the equivalent israeli society] have been attacked."" (icrc press release 00/37, 6 october 2000.) the attacks on ambulances and personnel appear to have overwhelmingly been a result of israeli military action or action by individual settlers against palestinian targets: the palestine red crescent society reports that, as of 16 november 2000, 42 prcs ambulances have been damaged and 51 personnel wounded or killed. however, there have been attacks by palestinian civilians against mda vehicles and personnel. four medical personnel of the mda were injured and 23  ambulances are reported to have been damaged by stoning by palestinians in the early period of the conflict. shootings at health personnel not visibly identified as doctors in one case reported by physicians for human rights-israel (phr-il) on 15 october, a doctor and his wife were shot at while driving in nazareth. dr amer ramadan and his wife, marlen, returned home after visiting amer ramadan's parents during a demonstration; 60 shots were fired at their car after they entered a one-way street the wrong way. as a result of the gunfire, marlen was seriously injured. when dr. ramadan got out of his car the police threw him on the ground and trod on him. he was prevented from assisting his wife who was removed from the scene by ambulance. he was kept at the scene until he was able to show the police his doctor's identification. only after half an hour was an ambulance allowed to evacuate him to the hospital where his wife was taken. the police refusal to allow him to assist his wife despite his protestations that he was a doctor is unacceptable. on 16 november 2000, a german chiropractor, harald fischer, was killed during an attack by israeli helicopter gunships on the west bank town of beit jala near bethlehem. witnesses cited by afp said mr fischer was hit by a shell or a rocket as he was leaving nhis house to help neighbours whose house was hit in the bombardment. an ambulance was prevented from reaching the scene by the intense fire at it was at least two hours before an ambulance reached his body which lay in the  middle of the road near his house. blocking access of patients and personnel to hospitals in the days following the commencement of the conflict there were several instances of blocking by israeli forces of access by palestinians to the main hospitals in east jerusalem, including makassed and augusta victoria hospitals. on 2 october at about 2pm demonstrators gathered in the village of arrabeh in israel and marched out of the village to a location symbolic of the village's confiscated lands in olive orchards near a rubbish dump, at a place where demonstrators posed no danger to life or property. police, including the army and special forces, were on the hillside above the demonstrators; they shot tear gas and then charged the demonstrators, who numbered about 200, firing rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition as they scattered. two demonstrators were killed: ala' khaled nasser, aged 22, and asil hassan 'asleh, aged 17. asil 'asleh had been a supporter of ""seeds of peace"", a group which worked for jewish-arab friendship. he was wearing his seeds of peace t-shirt when he died. witnesses say they saw him beaten to the ground by security forces; he was shot in the neck at close range. witnesses told amnesty international that an ambulance was called after he was shot, but did not arrive due to the restrictions on movement imposed by police and soldiers. asil 'asleh was taken by private car to the sakhnin medical centre to receive emergency first aid. he was then transferred to another hospital in nahariya, less than an hour away, but the ambulance in which he was being transported was delayed at several checkpoints. upon arrival at nahariya hospital, doctors immediately tried to operate on asil 'asleh, but he could not be saved. another death of a minor occurring during delayed access to medical care was reported by a phr-il field worker, salah haj-yihyeh, who witnessed a demonstration in sakhnin in the north of israel on 1 october 2000. he quoted ihab abu salah, one of those at the demonstration as saying: ""we called an ambulance for walid [his brother]. they said it would be difficult to get to hospital. it was an ambulance from the sakhnin medical centre. i went with the ambulance towards nahariya hospital. at the hill a policeman told us to stop. we shouted that it was urgent. he took no notice. i got down, pushed the policeman aside, and then we went off. they held us up about 5 minutes  he died on the way, about 5 minutes later"". others in visible need of medical attention were impeded in gaining access to hospital. the newsagency afp reported on 14 november 2000 that a palestinian woman was forced to give birth in a taxi after israeli troops prevented her from passing a checkpoint to reach the hospital. after going into labour, 27-year-old taqrit asuri and her husband amin sayed headed in a taxi from the village of al-ram to the nearest main hospital in ramallah in the west bank. however, ramallah and seven other west bank palestinian towns, were sealed off the previous day after four israelis were killed by palestinian gunmen. the taxi reached the checkpoint outside ramallah but was blocked by soldiers, who refused entry. the woman's husband pleaded desperately with the troops for about 30 minutes, before ordering the taxi driver to try another remote road into the city. the woman gave birth in the taxi which then drove to the nearest palestinian refugee camp hospital in qalandia where mother and newborn child were cared for. on 7 november, physicians for human rights (israel) issued a press release drawing attention to two incidents of health professionals being impeded by idf officers while travelling to the hospital where they worked. on 1 november, dr ghassan madiyeh and optometrist salah al-qadi were en route to st john's eye hospital, east jerusalem, on the road from bethlehem when they were stopped by police officers who refused to allow them to continue. when dr ghassan madiyeh showed his new travel permit, one soldier tore it up. they were later permitted to travel to the hospital. a similar incident was reported on 6 november when two staff members of the st john's eye hospital were stopped at the al-ram roadblock en route to east jerusalem despite their having appropriate documentation. israelis have also been prevented from having immediate access to medical care. one wounded israeli member of the border police died on 1 october 2000 after the palestinian authority failed to ensure his medical evacuation from joseph's tomb in nablus.  blocking movement of supplies and the injured the closure or restriction of gaza airport several times since 29 september 2000 has impeded the inward flow of supplies, including medical materials, and the outward travel of wounded individuals seeking treatment abroad. land transport across borders has also been blocked. at the end of october 2000, a convoy of trucks from the united nations relief and works agency (unrwa) containing materials donated by the jordanian authorities was refused passage into gaza at the karni crossing and had to turn back. the humanitarian and medical supplies were intended for ahli arab hospital and other health care institutions in gaza. according to unrwa, ""the imposition of a closure in the course of the current unrest has made it impossible for unrwa's palestinian drivers even with permits granted by the israeli security authorities to move in and out of gaza"". on 8 november the rafah border crossing was closed preventing about 30 trucks containing egyptian medical aid and food from entering gaza. the same day 10 trucks containing aid from oman were denied entry from egypt. the following day a convoy of four saudi arabian ambulances was turned away. medical neutrality persons regularly and solely engaged in the operation and administration of civilian hospitals, including the personnel engaged in the search for, removal and transporting of and caring for wounded and sick civilians, the infirm and maternity cases, shall be respected and protected. fourth geneva convention, article 20 the geneva conventions of 12 august 1949 and their additional protocols protect particular medical and paramedical staff (e.g. ambulance drivers) from military attack provided that they are clearly identified and are not engaged themselves in military action. the number of casualties involving health personnel suggests breaches of this important principle of international humanitarian law.      the idf has alleged that palestinian ambulances have been used to carry arms. the idf stated (1 november) that a red crescent ambulance had fired on the settler community of psagot. however amnesty international knows of no independent corroborating evidence of this. the icrc issued a press release on 1 november 2000 saying that it was ""gravely concerned"" by the allegations and noting: the abuse, or public allegations of abuse, of medical installations and vehicles endanger all medical, life-saving operations conducted under the red cross, red crescent or the magen david adom [emblems]. moreover, any attacks or reprisals on those medical personnel, ambulances or installations, as well as their perfidious misuse, indeed constitute a grave violation of international humanitarian law. lack of investigations into killings to amnesty international's knowledge no official forensic investigations into killings has been carried out. some evidence is available from hospitals and this has been reviewed by physicians for human rights in its recent report. amnesty  international criticised the lack of investigation by the appropriate authorities  into the circumstances of killings. in a meeting on 11 october 2000 between amnesty  international delegates and a spokesperson for the idf (the body primarily responsible for law enforcement in the occupied territories), the idf spokesperson made it clear that he felt that every death caused by the idf was justified. he stated that inquiries into the deaths of palestinians living in the pa's areas would be impossible since the idf had no access and did not even know the names of those who had died. with respect to killings of palestinian israeli inside israel, in november the israeli government announced the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry whose mandate ""was to investigate the clashes with security forces...in which jewish and arab israeli citizens were killed and wounded."" the pa has also failed to investigate deaths. each palestinian death in the area under the jurisdiction of the pa should have been fully investigated both by forensic studies at the scene of the crime, by questioning witnesses and by an autopsy. according  to information received by the amnesty international delegates, on no occasion have such investigations been carried out. palestinian doctors qualified in forensic medicine have informed amnesty international that on no occasion were they asked to carry out an autopsy (though the organization has since learned of one autopsy being carried out at the request of a family). blocking of medical care a long-standing problem the problem of disruptions of health care in the occupied territories (and later the palestinian authority) is a long-standing one. for years, israeli blockades have blocked access to ambulances and health workers. in 1988 the physicians for human rights (usa) reported on the lack of access to health workers by palestinians needing medical services during the intifada. the phr delegation said that they ""were frequently told with special urgency of repeated instances in which israeli soldiers and police had refused entry to ambulances, physicians and other health workers trying to reach the victims of beatings and shootings"". eight years later, in 1996, human rights watch reported similar impediments to health care as a result of israeli government policy. they said that ""the three-year closure [of borders] in the occupied territories [since march 1993] ... creates profound hardship [for palestinians] and, in some cases, humanitarian crises and even deaths."" in 1997, law, the palestinian society for the protection of human rights and the environment (and affiliate of the international commission of jurists) reported on the restricted access to medical care in the occupied territories. according to their report: ""the decision to allow palestinians to pass to hospitals are made by israeli soldiers, who have no medical training"". among the cases they cited was that of a 19 year-old pregnant bedouin woman about to give birth, who was denied permission to pass through the checkpoint and was forced to give birth in the car. the law report cited documentation by the union of palestinian medical relief committees of a series of similar restrictions, including restricted movement of medical personnel and of the movement of mobile medical clinics. a delegation from physicians for human rights (uk) and the johannes wier foundation (netherlands) visited israel and the occupied territories in 1997. they found that health services for palestinians were markedly inferior than those available for israelis and drew attention to the long- standing problem of the blocking of movement of health care professionals and patients' access to health care services in the occupied territories and the palestinian authority. the blocking or delaying of medical care continued up until and throughout the current conflict. the israeli human rights organization b'tselem has reported several deaths following such acts in 2000 but prior to 29 september. conclusion the current conflict has dramatically escalated the levels of killing and injury of palestinians and led to the deaths of some israelis. the level of fire power employed by the idf is excessive and has resulted in large numbers of unnecessary casualties. among the casualties have been health personnel, some of whom had been wearing clear identification. other breaches of medical neutrality have included ambulances being attacked and patients being prevented from getting access to health care. deaths have remained uninvestigated by both the israeli government and the palestinian authority. ai is calling on all parties to respect the geneva conventions and to protect and facilitate the delivery of medical care to the wounded and others in acute need such as pregnant women. ai further urges again the israeli authorities to refrain from the excessive use of force in the current conflict. recommended actions letters to the israeli government please write

""defiling the name of the prophet mohammed"" is a capital offence under section 295c of the pakistan penal code, which states, ""whoever by words, either spoken or written or by visible representation, or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the holy prophet mohammed (peace be upon him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to a fine"". the federal shariat court, whose tasks include reviewing laws to ensure they conform with islamic doctrine, ruled in 1991 that anyone convicted of blasphemy should face the death penalty, not life imprisonment. articles 18 and 19 of the universal declaration of human rights set out that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion and expression. international human rights law provides that any limitations placed on these freedoms should be only such as are prescribed by law as well as being necessary and proportionate for, among other things, the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. amnesty international considers people imprisoned under blasphemy laws for exercising their right to freedom of opinion and expression to be prisoners of conscience. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - calling for the president to use his powers under article 45 of the constitution to commute the death sentence handed down to younis masih on 30 may 2007; - calling for his immediate and unconditional release as a prisoner of conscience, as he is a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression; - calling on the authorities to take immediate and effective measures to guarantee the safety of younis masih, parvez aslam choudhry and their families; - calling on the authorities to order prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into threats, harassment and attacks against parvez aslam choudhry, and bring those responsible to justice; - expressing concern that the blasphemy laws are used to discriminate against religious minorities, and urging the government to abolish laws, including blasphemy laws, which provide for people to be punished for exercising their rights to freedom of opinion and expression; - calling for an immediate moratorium on all executions in the country, in line with the worldwide trends to abolish the death penalty with a view to an eventual abolition of the death penalty. appeals to: president pervez musharaf pakistan secretariat, islamabad, pakistan","update","",2,TRUE

it is not known how many innocent prisoners have been executed. the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, adopted by the un economic and social council in 1984, and endorsed by the un general assembly in december that year, state that 'capital punishment may only be imposed when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts.' background information as of january 1 1999, there were 3,549 prisoners on death row. a total of 520 inmates have been killed in the usa since the resumption of executions in 1977. only three states, texas, virginia and florida, have executed more condemned prisoners than missouri. the last execution in missouri took place on 23 february 1999. the governor of missouri, mel carnahan, can grant clemency in capital cases.  he recently commuted the death sentence of a convicted triple murderer, darrell mease, to life without parole, citing a personal plea by his holiness pope john paul ii. during a visit to the usa in january, the pope appealed for a consensus to end the death penalty, which he condemned as cruel and unusual, stating that the dignity of human life must not be taken away, even in the case of someone who has done great evil. in may 1996, the conviction of lloyd schlup, a missouri death row inmate, was overturned when an appeal court judge ruled that he was more likely than not innocent. schlup had been convicted in 1984 of a murder committed in prison, but was found to have had inadequate legal representation at his trial. his trial lawyer had failed to interview inmates who witnessed the killing and said that schlup was not involved in the murder. lloyd schlup had twice come close to execution. in 1993, governor  carnahan stayed his execution eight hours before it was due to take place because of doubts about his guilt.

on ua 283/08 (16 october 2008)  death penalty/legal concern usa (georgia)               troy anthony davis (m), black, aged 40 on 24 october, the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit granted troy davis a provisional stay of execution. he had been scheduled to be put to death on 27 october. he has been on death row for 17 years for a crime he maintains he did not commit. troy davis had exhausted his ordinary appeals against his conviction and death sentence, and the georgia board of pardons and paroles had denied clemency. on 22 october, daviss lawyers applied to the 11th circuit court for an emergency stay of execution and for permission to file a second habeas corpus petition, maintaining that his execution would be unconstitutional. in its decision issued on 24 october, the three-judge panel of the 11th circuit stated that entry of a stay on a second . . . habeas petition is a drastic measure, but upon our thorough review of the record, we conclude that davis has met the burden for a provisional stay of execution. the court then ordered the parties to address the question of whether troy davis can satisfy the stringent requirements under federal law to get back into court for further appeals on his innocence claim. specifically, the 11th circuit court ordered the parties to address the two-pronged question under the federal statute of whether (a) the basis for troy daviss claim of innocence could not have been discovered (and therefore raised in the courts) earlier, and (b) whether davis can show that, in the absence of constitutional error at the trial, the facts underlying his claim of innocence would mean that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty of the crime. in addition, the 11th circuit ordered the parties to address the question of whether davis can be executed if he can establish innocence under (b), but cannot satisfy his burden under (a), in other words that his claim could and should have been raised earlier. daviss lawyers have to file their written arguments within 15 days of the 11th circuits order. after receiving this brief, the government has 10 days to file its response. troy davis was convicted in 1991 of the murder of 27-year-old officer mark allen macphail who was shot and killed in the car park of a burger king restaurant in savannah, georgia on 19 august 1989. troy davis was also convicted of assaulting larry young, a homeless man, who was accosted immediately before officer macphail was shot. at the trial, troy davis admitted that he had been at the scene of the shooting, but claimed that he had neither assaulted larry young nor shot officer macphail. there was no physical evidence identifying troy davis as the gunman and the weapon used in the crime was never found. the case against him consisted of witness testimony. in affidavits signed over the years since the trial, a majority of the states witnesses have recanted or contradicted their testimony. in addition, there is post-trial testimony implicating another man as the gunman. in march 2008, the georgia supreme court denied troy davis a new trial or a court hearing in which post-conviction evidence could be presented. the chief justice of the state supreme court, joined by two other justices, dissented from this decision, arguing that in this case, nearly every witness who identified davis as the shooter at trial has now disclaimed his or her ability to do so reliably. three persons have stated that sylvester coles confessed to being the shooter. two witnesses have stated that sylvester coles, contrary to his trial testimony, possessed a handgun immediately after the murder. another witness has provided a description of the crimes that might indicate that sylvester coles was the shooter. the chief justice stated that the collective effect of all of daviss new testimony, if it were to be found credible by the trial court in a hearing, would show the probability that a new jury would find reasonable doubt of daviss guilt or a least sufficient residual doubt to decline to impose the death penalty. troy davis was less than two hours from execution on 23 september 2008 when the us supreme court issued a stay of execution to give it time to decide whether to hear his appeal against the georgia supreme courts ruling. the stay of execution was dissolved on 14 october when the court announced that it had decided not to take the case. the state of georgia immediately moved to set a new execution date. if the 11th circuit court of appeals decides that troy davis has not met his burden under the federal statute to be able to pursue further appeals, the state of georgia could again move to set another execution date. more than 300,000 people in the usa and around the world have appealed for executive clemency for troy davis. among them are former us president jimmy carter, archbishop desmond tutu and pope benedict xvi; the european union, the european parliament, and the secretary general of the council of europe; former fbi director william sessions, and former and current members of us congress bob barr, carol moseley braun and john lewis. on 23 october, the

http://www.amnesty-usa.org/urgact/ 22 november 1999 further information and request for action on ua 287/99 issued 3 november 1999 fear of torture/ill-treatment and new concern: medical concern usa (virginia)  perry connor, white phillip cordova, latino, aged 42 julian fuentes, latino joseph saavedra, latino raymond tahod and other inmates at wallens ridge state prison amnesty international remains concerned for the health and safety of inmates in virginias supermaximum security wallens ridge state prison. it is particularly concerned about the well-being of raymond tahod. in court on 3 november, perry connor, julian fuentes, joseph saavedra and raymond tahod testified about the alleged abuse they and other prisoners in wallens ridge had suffered. the men, who were transferred from prison in new mexico in september 1999, made their allegations by telephone from the supermax facility to a court hearing in santa fe, new mexico. the proceedings follow a legal action brought by a fifth new mexico inmate, phillip cordova, who is seeking an injunction to force his removal from wallens ridge. the next hearing is scheduled for 3 december. perry connor testified that he was stun gunned up to 12 times and beaten in the groin area until he lost control of his bowels. joseph saavedra testified that guards beat him in his cell, and subjected him to electro-shocks with stun guns. as they testified by phone from the prison, the inmates allegedly had a stun gun held against them, as well as being shackled, handcuffed, and held on a leash by a guard. when it came to raymond tahods turn to testify, he made only a minimal response. raymond tahod is said to have been labeled a troublemaker by guards for an incident that occurred during the inmates transfer to wallens ridge. a young inmate had suffered serious breathing difficulties and raymond tahod, concerned that the man might be dying, spoke out to demand that something be done (the inmate was later hospitalized). on arrival, the inmates were led off the bus one by one, with many of them allegedly beaten and/or electro-shocked with stun guns as part of their initiation. the first ones off the bus, who included raymond tahod, are said to have been the most severely abused. an attorney who recently visited the prison was unable to see him, raising concern over his current mental and physical health. the attorney saw several other inmates, who made allegations of torture, ill-treatment, threats, racism and lack of medical care. the medical records of the new mexico inmates are said not to have been transferred to wallens ridge. this raises particular concern in view of the use of electro-shock weapons, which amnesty international fears are potentially lethal against individuals with heart problems or other serious medical conditions. the organization has been told that whenever a prisoner is taken from his cell, shackled and handcuffed, he has a stun weapon held against him, increasing the risk of accidental or arbitrary activation. the prisoners who had contact visits with the attorney above were made to wear electro-shock stun belts, as well as handcuffs and shackles. there were also several armed guards in the room. none of the inmates had been asked if they had any medical condition before being made to wear the belt (see cruelty in control: the stun belt and other electro-shock equipment in law enforcement, amr 51/54/99, june 1999). amnesty international is also concerned by allegations relating to the use of strap down punishment cells in wallens ridge. it is claimed that prisoners who have been disciplined for alleged rule infractions have been placed in such a cell, handcuffed and strapped to a bed on their backs for 48 hours. the bed is directly under the light which is left burning the whole time (the lights are reportedly left on in all cells 24 hours a day). it is further alleged that guards have placed bets on when a prisoner will lose control of his bowels while held in this way. of the inmates named in this ua, julian fuentes is the only one who was part of a group of some 100 inmates transferred to wallens ridge from the privately-run guadalupe county correctional facility in new mexico after disturbances there in august (see original ua). the nine prisoners who were in the actual unit of that prison in which a guard was killed all reportedly remain in new mexico. those transferred to virginia include minimum and medium security prisoners, who have reportedly been labeled guard killers by wallens ridge staff and subjected to retaliatory abuse. the other four inmates named above were transferred with others from the maximum security state-run north unit of the penitentiary of new mexico in santa fe, for reasons which remain unclear. further recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters: - expressing concern for the well-being of prisoners held in wallens ridge state prison, and asking about the current health of raymond tahod; - seeking assurances that all new mexico prisoners are being protected from any form of retaliation linked to the court hearings in santa fe or the death of the prison guard in santa rosa in august; - seeking assurances that all prisoners, including raymond tahod, are being granted any medical attention they require; - noting allegations that the new mexico prisoners medical records have not been transferred, and expressing concern at the implications of this given the use of electro-shock weapons, whose safety is unproven; - expressing concern about alleged abuse associated with strap down cells; - calling for a full and independent investigation into the allegations of physical and psychological torture and ill-treatment in wallens ridge, and urging that the use of all stun weapons be suspended. appeals to: stan young, warden wallens ridge state prison po box 759 big stone gap, virginia 24219","","",2,TRUE

jebel moon area of west darfur on 29 october, leaving at least 67 men, women and children dead. other janjawid attacks, including killings and abductions, have taken place in other parts of darfur. local inhabitants say the janjawid are gathering in sawani and goz banat, areas close to jebel moon, apparently in preparation for further attacks. amnesty international is concerned for the safety of civilians who have fled the area, and of other villagers in west and north darfur states. the attacks started before dawn at ghribeish village and spread to other villages in the jebel moon area. they were carried out by janjawid, reportedly wearing sudanese military uniforms, on horseback and camels. according to reports, their uniforms and weapons were brand new, and were similar to the uniform and weapons of janjawid militia based at the sudanese armed forces camp at tina, on the chadian border. upon entering each village, those on horseback reportedly opened fire randomly on the residents, while those on camels rounded up the livestock. when they had killed or displaced the villagers, they plundered goods and burnt the rest of the harvest, so that villagers lost all of their food supply. they also reportedly damaged the water supply. first reports said that at least 32 children were among the dead, mostly in ghribeish, as this was the first village attacked, and people were taken by surprise. the other places attacked included the villages of awain, kishkish, sunait and garna, and the camp at hajilijah which contained 3,500 internally displaced people. the people attacked were mostly from the zaghawa, jebel and erenga ethnic groups. the attacks reportedly took place because of ethnic links between some villagers and the members of the justice and equality movement (jem) or the sudan liberation army (sla), armed opposition groups which have bases in the area. in addition to the civilians killed, some killed later in the day may have been members of the jem and the sla, who came and fought with the janjawid. according to reports, the majority of those living in the area have fled across the border to chad. others have gone to sileah, about four kilometres from hajilijah, which used to be an international humanitarian assistance point but has now been largely evacuated. hundreds of people are still believed to be hiding in the bush around jebel moon. humanitarian assistance cannot be provided due to insecurity throughout the area. the only access by international aid staff is by helicopter. the day after the attacks, on 30 october, military observers and other forces from the african union mission in sudan (amis) visited the area. villagers were said to have been angry at amis failure to protect them from the janjawid attacks. background information since the justice and equality movement (jem) and the sudan liberation army (sla) took up arms against the sudanese government in darfur in 2003, the sudanese government armed and supported local militia, known as the janjawid, as a proxy force against the rebels. the sudanese government and the janjawid deliberately targeted civilians of the same ethnicity as the rebel groups as a counter-insurgency strategy. some 85,000 people have been killed, around 200,000 have died as a result of conflict-related hunger or disease, and more than two million people have been displaced. rebel groups have also committed human rights abuses, including targeting humanitarian convoys and workers. amnesty international and the un have called the attacks committed in darfur crimes against humanity and war crimes. in may 2006, the sudanese government and one rebel group, a faction of the sudan liberation army led by minni minawi (known as the sla/ mm), signed the darfur peace agreement. the other sla faction and the jem refused to sign the agreement, saying it did not have enough guarantees on compensation, militia disarmament and political representation. since the signing of the agreement, insecurity has worsened in darfur, causing more killings of civilians, rapes and displacement. peacekeepers from the au have been present in darfur since 2004 with a mandate to protect civilians under imminent threat and in the immediate vicinity. however, citing a lack of resources and a limited mandate, they rarely protect civilians under attack. on 31 august, the un security council passed a resolution to send un peacekeepers in darfur to take over from the au. the sudanese government stated that it would refuse to allow the un to deploy troops in darfur, and sent more than 10,000 sudanese armed forces into darfur to restore security in the region. since 31 august the government has been attacking areas under the control of armed groups which have not signed the darfur peace agreement. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - condemning the killing of at least 67 civilians, including at least 32 children, in attacks by janjawid militias in the jebel moon area of west darfur on 29 october; - expressing concern for the safety of civilians in the area, particularly as reports suggest the janjawid are gathering there in preparation for further attacks; - urging the sudan government to immediately disarm the janjawid and bring to justice anyone involved in attacks on civilians; - calling on the sudan government to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches all those who need it in the area. appeals to: ali osman muammad taha second vice-president president's palace po box 281 khartoum,

such a thing would dishonor my sons memory... killing mr johnson, even if he is guilty, will not bring my son back and serves no purpose. killing mr johnson if he is innocent would be an abomination. amnesty international opposes all executions unconditionally. it also points out that the united nations safeguards guaranteeing the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. this execution would clearly flout this safeguard. indeed, as the state supreme court noted, even judge william keesley admitted that the crime may have happened differently from the scenario used to convict richard johnson. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of state trooper bruce smalls, explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of his death; - expressing deep concern that the state intends to kill richard johnson, despite continued doubts about his guilt, noting the dissents in the state supreme court, and the united nations safeguards; - expressing concern that the 1988 jury never knew that connie hess had recanted her 1986 trial testimony; - pointing out that co-defendant and jailhouse informant testimony is notoriously unreliable, and that such testimony has been the source of many errors around the country in death penalty cases; - urging the governor not to participate in an irrevocable injustice, but to commute richard johnsons death sentence. appeals to: governor jim hodges office of the governor po box 11829 columbia, sc 29211","","",2,TRUE

 prisoner of conscience/fear of forcible return ukraine  igor koktysh (m), belarusian social activist on 10 december, the european court of human rights ruled that belarusian citizen igor koktysh, a male social activist, supporter of the belarusian opposition and musician, should not be extradited to belarus. the ukrainian authorities have not yet indicated whether and when they will comply with this judgment. igor koktysh is a prisoner of conscience, held for the peaceful expression of his beliefs. in october 2007, igor koktysh filed a complaint with the european court of human rights to challenge his detention in ukraine and his planned extradition to belarus. in its judgment, the court ruled in favor of igor koktysh, and also stated that the conditions in which he is held amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. the court referred to findings of the european committee to prevent torture (cpt) and the ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights, who recorded that in the sizo where igor koktysh is being held there are dirty cells with insufficient daylight, insufficient nutrition and an overcrowding so that detainees have to take turns in sleeping. the judgment acknowledges that igor koktysh would face a serious risk of torture or ill-treatment if returned to belarus. according to the court, the possibility of igor koktysh being sentenced to death at an unfair trial in belarus would constitute another violation of human rights. the court stated that there is no legal basis for igor koktyshs detention in ukraine and that he has been unable to challenge the lawfulness of his detention. igor koktysh is currently held in a detention center (sizo) in the southern ukrainian city of simferopol. he is asthmatic and suffers from a range of other related health problems. according to his wife, he had a serious asthma attack on 28 november, and was not given any medication until his wife brought some when she visited two days later. igor koktysh has told his lawyer that he fears he will die in detention and that if he were to suffer a serious asthma attack the prison doctors would not be equipped to save his life. background information igor koktysh, a citizen of belarus, has been detained in ukraine since june 2009 after belarus requested his extradition over an accusation that he carried out a murder in belarus in 2001. he is currently held in a detention centre (sizo) in the southern ukrainian city of simferopol. igor koktysh, a musician in the banned rock group mlechny put (milky way), was socially and politically active in belarus. he was a founding member of a youth group financed by the catholic church, which aimed to rehabilitate young drug users. igor koktysh organized rock festivals to publicize the message ""no to drugs and violence"". at these festivals opposition flags and slogans were displayed. igor koktysh was also an active member of the youth opposition movement zubr (since disbanded), and took part in a number of political campaigns. in 2000 igor koktysh tried to start an independent youth organization, the informal youth movement, but the authorities refused to register the group. in january 2001, he was detained in belarus and accused of murder of a close friends relative. a senior police officer allegedly told him that he knew he was not guilty of the crime, but that he was under pressure from his superiors. in custody he was allegedly tortured and ill-treated, including by being beaten and locked naked in a very cold cell, in order to force him to confess. being able to prove that he was in another city when the murder took place, he was acquitted and released. this verdict was confirmed by the supreme court of belarus on 1 february 2002. after igor koktysh had moved to ukraine in april 2002, in an unusual move the belarusian prosecutor general appealed against the verdict and the case was returned to the lower court for a retrial - hence the request for extradition. on 25 june 2007, he was detained by ukrainian police following an extradition request from belarus for the same charges of premeditated, aggravated murder, under article 139 of the criminal code of belarus which carries the death penalty. in ukraine, igor koktysh continued to be actively involved in supporting the belarusian opposition candidate during the presidential election campaign in belarus in 2006. igor koktysh created videos, website banners and composed songs supporting the candidate. he also created a website for the unregistered informal youth movement which contained opposition leaflets and posters. igor koktysh applied for refugee status in ukraine, but his application was rejected on 23 october 2008. his lawyer has appealed against this decision. igor koktysh filed a complaint to the european court of human rights in october 2007 to challenge his extradition to belarus and his detention pending extradition. in october 2007 the court called on the government of ukraine to not extradite him before the court has considered the case. the court did so with yesterdays verdict, ruling in igor koktyshs favour. in addition to the abovementioned findings, the court noted that igor koktysh had been acquitted for the charges on which the extradition is based by the belarusian courts at two instances in 2001. the assurances given by the belarusian prosecutor general with regard to igor koktyshs treatment after extradition were considered to be insufficient guarantee for his protection against ill-treatment or torture. the court also held that there was no effective or accessible remedy available to igor koktysh by which to complain about the conditions of his detention and that, in this regard, there had been a violation of his right to an effective remedy, according to article 13. a number of international human rights conventions to which ukraine is a state party prohibit the deportation or extradition of anyone to a country where he or she may face the death penalty, torture or other ill-treatment or other grave human rights violations. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - calling on the ukrainian authorities to comply with the judgment of the european court of human rights without delay and to release igor koktysh immediately and unconditionally; - calling on the ukrainian authorities to ensure that igor koktysh receives full compensation in accordance with the judgment of the european court of human rights; - urging the ukrainian authorities to ensure that he is provided with effective and durable protection against return to any country, including belarus, where he would be at risk of the death penalty, torture or other grave human rights violations. appeals to: president viktor yushchenko vul. bankovaya 11 01220 kyiv, ukraine","update","",3,TRUE

sellers was convicted of the murder of his mother and stepfather and for killing a shopkeeper. when sean sellers tried to express his remorse at the hearing to the relatives of his victims, his uncle shouted ""stop begging. take your punishment"". at the hearing, one of the jurors from the 1986 trial urged the board to recommend clemency. she recalled how the jurors at the trial had not believed sean sellers would ever be executed, as there had been no execution in oklahoma for two decades. she claimed that they had voted for death because they feared that otherwise the defendant would be released from prison within a few years. the court had not allowed them to hear expert testimony that the length of a life sentence in oklahoma meant at least 15 years in prison without parole. the defence had wished to counteract local newspaper articles suggesting that life imprisonment meant release in under half that time. the juror at the clemency hearing told of how she had learned of, and been moved by, sean sellers personal development on death row and his work to help other troubled teenagers. it is precisely this potential for change in a young person which lies behind the global ban on the use of the death penalty against children. in the days leading up to the clemency hearing and execution, in the face of growing national and international publicity on the case and opposition to the imminent execution, local newspapers published articles claiming sean sellers was a ""manipulative"" individual and had invented his mental illness.  this was despite the fact that in 1998 a federal court had acknowledged undisputed expert testimony about his serious mental illness. the extent of this illness was not raised at his trial because clinical tests for his condition had not yet been developed. the american bar association and archbishop desmond tutu of south africa were among those who wrote to governor keating urging that the execution be halted. following the rejection of clemency, amnesty international appealed to international bodies to do all they could to prevent the execution. the organization of american states, the united nations high commissioner for human rights and defence for children international were among those who called for the execution to be stopped. on 1 february, amnesty international wrote an open letter to president clinton, the leaders of the us senate and the chief justice of the us supreme court, calling for their intervention (see amr 51/20/99). noting that questions of morality, responsibility and leadership in politics were currently high on the us political agenda, amnesty international challenged the federal authorities to live up to their international legal obligations in the case of sean sellers and to join the global moral consensus that the execution of child offenders is wrong. the organization does not yet know if the federal authorities made any effort to prevent the execution. on the same day as sean sellers clemency hearing, pope john paul ii challenged the usa to reject the cruelty of the death penalty. however, immediately after the hearing, oklahomas governor, a catholic, welcomed the rejection of clemency, and in television interviews on 3 february, said that the pope was ""wrong"" on the death penalty, and that catholic theology supports capital punishment. the archbishop of oklahoma city is reported to have reacted strongly against the governors statements.  even before the clemency hearing, the governor had said that he would not grant sean sellers clemency. sean sellers was the 13th person since 1977 to be executed in the us for a crime committed when he was under 18. the others were all 17 at the time of their offences. the usa, which has carried out the worlds last four executions of child offenders, has now executed more such prisoners since 1990 than the rest of the world combined, as far as amnesty international is aware. sean sellers was the 512th prisoner executed in the usa since executions resumed in 1977. twelve have been executed in 1999 so far, and at least another 11 are scheduled to die in february. many thanks to all who sent appeals on behalf of sean sellers. local press  reported that the authorities were ""inundated"" with appeals. participants may write to governor keating and the federal authorities expressing deep regret at the execution and calling on the usa to meet its international obligations and to stop using the death penalty against those under 18 at the time of the crime. governor keating 212 state capitol oklahoma city, ok 73105 ","","1998-12-03",3,TRUE

penalty 04 june 2003 usa (indiana)   joseph l. trueblood (m), joseph trueblood, aged 46, is scheduled to be executed in indiana on 13 june 2003. he was sentenced to death in 1990 for the august 1988 murders of his former girlfriend susan bowsher and her two young children, ashlyn bowsher, aged 2, and one-year-old william bowsher. all three were shot dead. joseph trueblood initially pleaded guilty to shooting susan bowsher, and not guilty to the murder of the children. even before this, truebloods then lawyer indicated to the judge that he believed his client should plead guilty and that he planned to loosen [trueblood] up by taking him to the site where the bodies had been buried and by showing him videos of the exhumations. sentencing for the murder of susan bowsher was deferred until after the trial for the childrens murders. on the second day of this trial in february 1990, the prosecution introduced gruesome photographs of the childrens dead bodies, and joseph truebloods twin brother testified for the state that joseph had confessed to all three killings. at the end of that day, the defense attorneys, with the assistance of their clients mother, convinced joseph trueblood to withdraw his not guilty plea and to plead guilty to the murder of the children. the absence of a plea arrangement suggests that the lawyers believed that if he pled guilty, the judge would not sentence him to death. the trial judge ordered a pre-sentencing report by a probation officer. the latter interviewed joseph trueblood. in that interview, at which his lawyer was not present, trueblood denied killing the children, but said that he had pleaded guilty because he believed a jury would sentence him to death. based on this statement, truebloods trial attorneys sought to have trueblood withdraw the guilty plea, and to themselves be allowed to withdraw from the case. their motions were denied. joseph trueblood testified in court that he had not killed the children, and that he had only changed his plea because he believed that a jury would wrongly convict him. the judge told trueblood that his testimony was counterfeit. after a sentencing hearing in april 1990, the judge sentenced joseph trueblood to death. the indiana supreme court upheld the death sentence. however, in july 2001 a federal judge ruled that the indiana courts finding that truebloods plea of guilty to the murder of susan bowsher had been knowing and voluntary had been unreasonable. this, he said, was because trueblood had not been advised that his guilty plea was also an admission of an  aggravating circumstance, i.e. an additional factor making him eligible for the death penalty if he was later convicted of killing one or both of the children. the federal judge said that he cannot imagine a greater consequence in a capital case than this. the federal judge also found that the indiana supreme court had unreasonably applied us supreme court precedent when it found that joseph truebloods lawyer had acted competently when he advised his client to plead guilty to the murder of susan bowsher. he wrote that the defense lawyers failure to understand the full consequences of the plea and failure to explain those consequences to trueblood cannot be considered adequate representation. however, the state appealed against the federal judges finding that joseph trueblood should receive a new trial, and in august 2002 the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit reinstated the death sentence. like many on death row in the usa, joseph trueblood comes from a background of abuse, and is mentally impaired. in post-conviction investigations, a mental health expert concluded that joseph trueblood suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his abusive childhood. prior to the 1990 trial, a clinical neuropsychologist found that joseph trueblood had brain damage and sub-average intellectual functioning. this testimony was not presented to the trial judge, because the trial lawyers thought it would suggest that joseph trueblood was not amenable to rehabilitation, and that the neuropsychologists testimony would therefore conflict with that of another expert whom the defense presented on the issue of the defendants rehabilitative potential. however, the trial lawyers never asked the two experts for their view of this potential conflict, and in post-conviction proceedings both experts testified that, in their view, joseph trueblood would adapt well to the structured life of prison and that there would have been no conflict between their testimonies. at a clemency hearing before the indiana parole board on 27 may 2003, evidence was presented of joseph truebloods exemplary prison record. the board was also asked to consider the fact that he had once saved a womans life who had been trapped in a burning building, and that he had also saved his cousin from drowning. the state presented its case against clemency. a friend of susan bowshers urged the board to allow the execution to go forward. she was quoted as saying: we will be taking the life of a man who has admitted his guilt for the killing of two innocent children and their mother. i only wish joe trueblood could die three times over for the killing of three people. on 28 may, the board voted to recommend that the governor deny clemency. the case is now before the governor. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity and every execution is a symptom of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. the death penalty extends the suffering of one family, that of the murder victim, to another, the loved ones of the prisoner. today, 112 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. the usa has put 855 men and women to death since resuming executions in 1977. indiana accounts for 10 of these killings. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of susan bowsher and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of her or her childrens deaths or to minimize the suffering caused; - opposing the execution of joseph trueblood; - noting that the trial court did not hear evidence of joseph truebloods brain damage, or of his possible post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his abusive childhood; - noting the federal courts finding that joseph trueblood should have been granted a new trial because he had not been advised of the consequences of his guilty plea; - noting joseph truebloods model record in prison and his saving of two lives, mitigating evidence not considered by any court; - urging the governor to commute joseph truebloods death sentence. appeals to:

that angel diaz never told him that he was the gunman; and that he did not know from his communication with diaz who had shot joseph nagy. he states that his testimony to the contrary was motivated by anger at angel diaz and a desire to gain favor from the state on his own murder charge. ralph gajus had testified at the trial that he had not been promised anything in return for his testimony. however, at his own sentencing a police officer had testified about the assistance gajus had provided to the state in the diaz case. during the jurys deliberations at the trial of angel diaz, the jurors requested copies of the testimony of ralph gajus, but the judge refused, instructing the jury to rely on its recollection of what he had said. the jury returned a guilty verdict. ralph gajuss recantation further calls into question the reliability of their verdict. at the sentencing, it was argued in mitigation against a death sentence that angel diaz had only been an accomplice to the crime, but no new evidence of this was presented. research in the usa has shown that residual doubt about guilt is a highly mitigating factor in the minds of capital jurors. although the jury recommended a death sentence for angel diaz, they did so only by eight votes to four, indicating possible residual doubt in the minds of the jurors even with the testimony of ralph gajus. without it, it is possible that more of the jurors would have voted against a death sentence. in post-conviction proceedings, evidence not raised at the trial has been raised about angel diazs childhood of abuse and mental problems, and his addiction to drugs from the age of 16. it has also been claimed that the prosecution failed to disclose evidence that it was angel toro who shot joseph nagy. in a memorandum dated 6 february 1984, the prosecutor wrote: at some point, all three subjects pulled out guns and announced a robbery. shots were fired. defendant toro apparently grabbed gina fredericks around the neck and took her back to the area of the office where the safe was located. apparently, victim nagy came out of the office at that time. defendant toro shot nagy once in the chest causing his death. testimony given by people who are themselves in custody or facing criminal prosecution has been shown to be frequently unreliable. research at northwestern university in illinois has revealed that the use of such informants was among the three most prevalent factors in wrongful capital convictions in the united states. a review of 111 such cases from 1973 to 2004 in the usa found the use of false testimony in 46 per cent of the cases. the commission on capital punishment, set up by the governor of illinois after he imposed a moratorium on executions in 2000, examined the question of such testimony. the commissions april 2002 report concluded that, even with stringent safeguards on the use of such evidence, the potential for testimony of questionable reliability remains high, and imposing the death penalty in such cases appears ill-advised. the california commission on the fair administration of justice has recently issued its recommendation on the use of informant testimony. the commission, established by the california state senate to examine the causes of wrongful convictions, and to make recommendations to ensure the fair and reliable administration of criminal justice in california, has recommended that the legislature adopt a law barring the use of in-custody informant testimony in criminal trials without independent corroborating evidence. a recent study conducted under the auspices of the american bar associations death penalty moratorium implementation project identified serious problems in floridas capital justice system, including the high number of people released from death row on the grounds of innocence (22 since 1973  more than illinois, where a moratorium resulted), the continued existence of racial and geographic disparities, the fact that unanimity is not required in jury sentencing decisions, and the failure to give sufficient weight to the mitigating effects of serious mental disability. further recommended action: please continue to send appeals based on the original ua and this new information, to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family of joseph nagy, who was killed in 1979, and explaining that you are not seeking to downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused; - opposing the execution of angel nieves diaz, noting evidence calling into question his competency to stand trial and represent himself; - noting the disparity in sentencing in this case, with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman; - noting that ralph gajus, a key prosecution witness at the trial, has now recanted his testimony against angel diaz, calling into further doubt the reliability of the jurys verdict; - noting that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty, indicating a possible residual doubt in their minds about the defendants guilt, and suggesting that without the testimony of ralph gajus more of the jurors might have voted against a death sentence; - noting that recent research has found serious problems with floridas capital justice system, including geographic and racial disparities, and the lack of a requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions; - calling on the governor to intervene to stop this execution. appeals to: governor jeb bush the capitol 400 south monroe street tallahassee fl 32399","update","",2,TRUE

yet up to then an unwritten rule had been that four votes were enough for the court to decide to hear oral arguments in a case. the courts rejection of the tarver appeal 5-4 appears to signal that prisoners will now have to reach five votes to obtain such a hearing in the court. governor siegelman had already denied clemency for robert tarver when the us supreme court stay was announced. amnesty international is urging that he reconsider this decision. as of 1 january 2000, there were 185 prisoners on death row in alabama. it  has executed 21 prisoners since 1977, including two this year. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: - expressing sympathy for the victims of violent crime and their families, and explaining that you do not seek to excuse the killing of hugh kite; - expressing concern that robert lee tarver is facing execution for the murder; - expressing concern that the state prosecutor acted in a racially discriminatory manner during jury selection when he removed all but one african american from the jury pool; - noting that the credibility of a key prosecution witness was undermined by the alleged pre-trial plea agreement between him and the state; - noting that the jury and the trial judge in post-conviction ultimately both reached the conclusion of a sentence of life imprisonment, rather than a death sentence;

(see update to extra 50/00 (amr 51/94/00, 8 june 2000). the execution of wesley baker has been scheduled despite the fact that a university of maryland study into the states capital justice system is not due to be completed until september 2002. its prime focus is the impact of race on capital sentencing. governor glendening commissioned the study after his task force on the fair imposition of capital punishment concluded in 1996 that in maryland the high percentage of african-american prisoners under sentence of death and the low percentage of prisoners under sentence of death whose victims were african-american remains a cause for concern. marylands population is 64 per cent white and 28 per cent black. of the 13 prisoners on its death row in april 2002, nine (70 per cent) were black and four were white. in 12 of the 13 cases (92 per cent) the victims of the crimes were white, although around 75 to 80 per cent of murder victims in maryland are black. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, maryland has executed three prisoners, two black and one white. all three were convicted of killing whites. wesley baker is african american; jane tyson was white. the lt governor of maryland, kathleen kennedy townsend, a likely candidate for the 2002 state gubernatorial campaign, has indicated her support for a moratorium in the event that the study shows that race plays a role in the states death penalty system. geographical disparities are also evident in marylands death penalty system. wesley baker was prosecuted by baltimore county (population 74 per cent white, 20 per cent black), which accounts for 14 per cent of marylands population. of the 13 on death row in maryland, nine (70 per cent) were prosecuted in baltimore county, a jurisdiction which accounts for less than 10 per cent of the states murders. a major study of the us death penalty at columbia law school names baltimore county as one of the us counties with the highest death sentencing rates, as well as the highest error rates in capital cases. recommended action: please send appeals, in your own words, using the following guide: in appeals to both addressees: - expressing sympathy for the family of jane tyson, and explaining that you are in no way seeking to excuse the manner of her death; - expressing deep concern at the imminent execution of wesley baker; - noting residual doubts about whether he was the gunman, and praising governor glendenings principled stand in the eugene colvin-el case because of such doubts; - noting that this case involves precisely the sort of racial, as well as geographical, disparities that have raised serious questions about marylands capital justice system; - stating that in addition to the residual doubt, it would be unconscionable to allow any execution to go ahead before the results and recommendations of the study commissioned by governor glendening are known. in appeals to governor parris glendening: - urge him to commute wesley bakers death sentence, and to impose a moratorium on executions in maryland. in appeals to lt. governor kathleen kennedy townsend: - noting her support for a moratorium in the event that the study shows that race has played a role in capital sentencing, and requesting her to urge governor glendening to commute wesley bakers death sentence. appeals (in equal numbers) to: the honorable parris glendening governor of maryland state house, annapolis, maryland 21401","","",2,TRUE

a highly damaging testimony in relation to the defendants possible future dangerousness. however, the jury was left unaware of the inconsistency between this testimony and what the friend had originally told the police, namely that he did not remember hearing swisher say he could do it again. the claims that the state knowingly elicited perjured testimony from this witness, or that swishers inexperienced trial lawyers were ineffective for failing to draw the jurys attention to the inconsistency in the testimony, have been rejected by the appeal courts. the claim that the prosecutor unlawfully failed to turn over to the defence lawyers evidence that the friend had sought and received a reward in exchange for his testimony has also been dismissed. virginia lies behind only texas in the number of executions carried out since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977. virginia accounts for 88 of the 860 executions carried out nationwide since then. further recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of dawn mcnees snyder, explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of her death or the suffering it will have caused; - welcoming the reprieve granted to bobby swisher, but expressing concern that the governor has said that he will allow the execution to proceed on 22 july if the prisoner is denied relief in the courts on the issue of the jury verdict form; - reiterating concern at allegations of ineffective legal representation and prosecutorial misconduct in this case; - noting that the jury were unaware of inconsistencies in the testimony of the states key witness; - noting evidence of bobby swishers medically sedated state during trial, and expressing concern that this could have contributed to jurors perceiving a lack of remorse on his part; - urging the governor to commute bobby swishers death sentence in the event that the courts deny relief. appeals to: governor mark r. warner state capitol, 3rd floor richmond, virginia 23219","update","2003-06-09",3,TRUE

pakistan (two); democratic republic of congo (drc - one); nigeria (one); and iran (three). in 2001, the president of pakistan announced that he would commute the death sentences of all child offenders on death row in his country. amnesty international knows of no executions since december 2000 in the drc, where there is currently a moratorium on judicial killing. napoleon beazley came hours from execution in august 2001. appeals for clemency had come from many quarters. the district attorney of houston county, whose jurisdiction includes the beazley familys home town of grapeland and who is a strong advocate of the death penalty, called for commutation. a former warden of death row in texas, who oversaw 22 executions, also opposes the execution. in a remarkable development, judge cynthia kent, who oversaw napoleon beazleys 1995 trial and who set his execution dates, wrote to governor perry in august 2001 urging clemency, citing the prisoners age at the time of the crime as reason for commutation. eighteen members of the texas legislature then wrote to the governor: we join judge kent in her request for commutation of napoleon beazleys death sentence because we are greatly disturbed by the fact that texas is now almost the sole executioner of child offenders in the world. we desire texas to be in the lead among states and nations in affording her citizens the protection they deserve to be given under universally-recognized, fundamental, human rights norms. at the recent hearing at which his execution date was set, napoleon beazley spoke of his remorse. in chains, weeping, he apologized to all who had been affected by the crime, first and foremost, to mrs luttig and her family. in texas, the governor can grant clemency if the board of pardons and paroles recommends it. in august 2001, it rejected clemency by a vote of 10-6, an unusually high number of votes for commutation. at the time the board was unaware of judge kents appeal. for more information, see too young to vote, old enough to be executed , amr 51/105/2001, july 2001, and death in black and white , amr 51/117/2001, 9 august 2001. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of john luttig, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of his death;

- opposing the execution of richard cooey; - noting that at the time of the crime, richard cooey was a teenager emerging from a violent and abusive family environment, and that he had a long history of alcohol and drug abuse; - suggesting that the state should seek to constructive solutions to the cycle of violence and abuse, not perpetuate it by killing another person; - noting that the power of executive clemency, unlike the courts, can take into account efforts of the prisoner towards rehabilitation and reform;

the so-called future dangerousness question. the texas court of criminal appeals (tcca) upheld martinezs death sentence in 1996. four of the nine judges dissented, saying that the evidence of his future dangerousness was insufficient to support a death sentence, and that a proper analysis of the relevant precedent demanded that the death sentence be overturned. one of the dissenters wrote: we have the duty of ensuring death sentences are imposed in an evenhanded, rational and consistent manner... today, the majority shirks that responsibility and issues an opinion that insulates jury verdicts from meaningful appellate review... in light of the majority opinion, there is no longer any assurance that the death penalty will not be wantonly or freakishly imposed. another of the dissenters wrote: every murder committed in the course of a robbery is in some way cold-blooded and senseless. each such murder does not, however, merit the death penalty, our most final punishment... this opinion will probably set a precedent ensuring that never again will there be facts that this court will find insufficient to support an affirmative answer to the [future dangerousness question]. the dissent continued that the majority had contorted the facts of the case in order to uphold the death sentence. the tcca then appointed a lawyer to represent johnny martinez for his further, habeas corpus , appeals. this lawyer had never handled such an appeal, and asked the court on several occasions for permission to withdraw from the case. in 1997, the lawyer filed an appeal, without having once spoken to or visited his client, having refused to accept telephone calls from him, and having sent him only one brief letter. the appeal was five and a half pages long. two of the four claims raised comprised 17 lines of text with three inches of margin, with no cases cited. habeas corpus applications filed by adequately funded, experienced lawyers routinely run to more than 150 pages because of the number of issues raised and the complexity of the law. the appeal did not challenge the adequacy of johnny martinezs trial representation, even though his trial lawyer had done little investigation or preparation for the sentencing phase. the tcca dismissed the appeal. one of the judges dissented, citing the brevity and lack of quality of the appeal. he wrote that the merits of the appeal should not be assessed, but that the adequacy of the appeal lawyers performance should be examined. the lawyer himself agreed with the dissent, again asking to withdraw from the case because of his inexperience. new lawyers later appointed for martinezs federal appeals discovered substantial mitigating factors that had not been presented to the trial jury, including evidence that johnny martinez had been subjected to sexual and physical abuse as a child, and of his dysfunctional family background, including his mothers selling and use of heroin. given johnny martinezs youth, intoxication, remorse, cooperation with the police, and non-violent history, such mitigation evidence, the federal appeal lawyers argued, might have affected the sentence. however, the federal courts have ruled that the claim of inadequate trial counsel is procedurally barred from being evaluated because the claim was not raised in the state courts. the federal district court expressed concern at this harsh outcome - given that the issue was lost to judicial review because of the incompetence of the state habeas lawyer - but the federal court considered itself bound by precedent. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. in the usa it is a punishment supposedly reserved for the worst of the worst. in reality, it is disproportionally reserved for the poor and the inadequately represented. international standards require that capital defendants be provided with adequate legal assistance at all stages of proceedings ;. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 776 prisoners have been put to death in 32 states. texas accounts for 267 of these executions. there have been 27 executions in the usa this year, 11 of them in texas. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: -

- recognising as an important first step the farcs acknowledgement of responsibility for the crime; - urging that the those reportedly responsible for the crime be submitted to a judicial process that is independent and impartial in order to establish their guilt or innocence; - expressing concern that the judicial procedures under which ""gildardo"" is to be tried by the farc do not meet international standards and can therefore not guarantee a fair trial; - calling on the secretariat of the farc not to execute summarily the farc commander ""gildardo"" who is alleged to be responsible for kidnapping and killing of the three us citizens; - expressing unconditional opposition to the death penalty in all cases as a violation of the right to life and of the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, as proclaimed in the universal declaration of human rights. appeals to: international secretariat of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia secretariado internacional de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia (farc)","","",2,TRUE

'don't think about the children' by gideon levy haaretz, 12 december 2003 why was asma abu al-haija arrested? why did she have to spend nine months in prison, sleeping on the floor of her cell? why was a woman arrested, not interrogated, not accused of anything and then released nine very difficult months later, without any explanation? just because she is a palestinian, so anything can be done to her? was she really arrested solely in order to put pressure on her husband, the hamas spokesman in jenin, who is also in israeli prison? is this legal? moral? could there be any other reason? if so, why wasn't she brought to trial for it? forget justice, but what about a drop of compassion for a sick woman with a brain tumor, who is going blind, has undergone brain surgery twice, who has five children left alone at home in the refugee camp, without a mother, without a father, without their older brother? all these questions continue to hover in the attractive home in the heart of the jenin refugee camp, the home to which asma abu al-haija finally returned a few weeks ago. she returned to her five free children and to a house that had been refurbished, and of course, there was much happiness. asma says the children became very independent when she was away. one after the other, they returned from school one afternoon this week, kissed their mother and tossed down their bookbags, as if nothing unusual had happened. only 7-year-old sajida still gets up sometimes in the middle of the night, frightened by the sound of tanks or jeeps in the street, and leaps into her mother's bed to hold her tight. sajida has not forgotten that cold, dark night in february when the soldiers came and took her mother away. she won't ever forget it. the birdcage is gone. for all those months, while workers repaired the house that had been wrecked by an idf missile and the children were living there alone, the birdcage hung on the wall of the guest room and the chirping sounds gave the lonely children a little feeling of hope and warmth. now only the electric doorbell at the entrance to the house still chirps like a bird. ""i want mommy,"" sajida told us on our first visit about six months ago. a month later, she proudly displayed the new dress - beige with embroidery - that she had bought for her mother for nis 100 at the al-wafa store in jenin, and the brown sandals and white veil - all in anticipation of her mother's release. israel had just promised to ease conditions for the palestinians and to make some goodwill gestures, and the people of jenin were sure that the most humane gesture would be to release the ailing asma. imad, her teenage son, got up early in the morning and went to the checkpoint to meet his mother. he stood in the sun for two hours until he realized that, goodwill gestures or not, his mother was not coming. there was much crying at home, and then they went back to their lives, without a mother or a father. asma abu al-haija was born 40 years ago in jenin. at 19, she married a man now known as sheikh jamal, a religion teacher and son of the imam of jenin. they lived in yemen and saudi arabia for 10 years and returned to jenin during the gulf war. since then, sheikh jamal has been in one prison after another: six months in the palestinian authority prison, followed by seven arrests by israel. he was wanted for two years by the idf, and was caught and arrested about two years ago. in the brief interludes between his incarcerations, he appeared on international arab television stations as the hamas spokesman in jenin. asma says her husband is a politician. they haven't seen each other for two years. six months before jamal was apprehended, their eldest son, abd al-salam was sentenced to 87 months in prison for his activities in hamas. jamal is still awaiting a verdict in his trial. on february 11 of this year, at 3 a.m., soldiers knocked on the door of the house. asma got dressed and went downstairs. she was ill, suffering from terrible headaches caused by the tumor in her brain. the soldiers burst in, overturning everything in their path. the children were terrified. sajida and hamzi, the two youngest, cried. they were all ordered to go out into the street, in the cold and rain, until the search was finished. then they were all brought into one room and a soldier called `captain jamal' came in. ""we want to take you in for questioning,"" the captain said. ""i haven't done anything. i just take care of the children,"" asma tried to protest. ""the shin bet wants to talk to you. two words and you'll be back home."" having no choice, she accompanied the soldiers. she says she didn't take anything with her, because captain jamal said it would just be ""two words"" with the shin bet. the children shouted. banan, a 17-year-old girl, said to the soldiers: ""take all of us, then. why do you come and take someone else every time?"" and asma told the captain that she had to call someone to watch the children until morning. she was sure she'd be back very soon. but she remembers hearing one of the soldiers say to the children: ""find yourselves another mother."" they took her in a jeep to the idf detention facility in salem. she tried to ask why they couldn't just question her at home. at salem, other soldiers ordered that her hands and legs be bound and that she be blindfolded. she tried to explain that she gets severe headaches from a brain tumor. but the soldiers told her: ""it's the law here. we have to.""she asked to see a doctor. they brought her a female prison warden. she was put into a small room and there asma took off her headscarf and showed her the scars on her head from her two surgeries. the warden told the soldiers: ""she really does have scars on her head."" but asma remained bound and blindfolded. they offered her something to eat and she refused. at noon, she was taken to the neve tirza women's prison in ramle. there was no interrogation and no shin bet. ""i have a brain tumor,"" she told the prison doctor the next day. she was suffering from pain and dizziness. she says the doctor told her: ""don't think about the children. if you think about the children - it causes headaches."" ""do you have children?,"" asma asked her. ""that's different. you're in prison and your situation is different,"" was the reply. for the next seven months, asma had no contact with her children, who were at home alone. she had no idea how they were, what was happening to them, who - if anyone - was looking after them. she asked the prison supervisor to at least let her call home once, but was turned down. the supervisor suggested that she get a lawyer to talk with the children, but asma wanted to hear their voices herself. ""the security prisoner was denied telephone calls because of the procedure that applies to all security prisoners in israel,"" was the response at the time from the prison service. asma complained to her lawyer, tamar peleg-sarik, that she wasn't receiving proper medical attention. about a month after she was arrested, physicians for human rights (phr) sent an urgent letter to the prison authorities requesting that a ct scan be arranged for asma. it was two and a half months before the examination was performed. phr informed prof. shlomo melamed, director of the glaucoma institute at sheba medical center, and he volunteered to go the prison to examine her. he found that asma had completely lost her vision in her left eye and that she was suffering from severe headaches, dizziness and nausea. horrified, prof. melamed posted a stinging article on the internet: "" it is incomprehensible that this woman could be held in detention without trial for eight months. where is the human compassion? where is the famous jewish mercy? why has she not even been permitted to speak to her children by phone, throughout her imprisonment?"" tear gas used to quell a disturbance by the female prisoners affected her especially hard and caused ferocious headaches. when asma finished serving her first term of administrative detention - six months - and was expecting to be released, the next blow fell: her detention was being extended by another five months. she says she fainted when she was told the news. all she knew was that a military judge had approved the regional military commander's request to extend her detention without trial, saying she was a terrorist. she is convinced that her incarceration was intended solely to put pressure on her husband, who was imprisoned in be'er sheva. there was one happy moment: one day in september, during the daily walk in the prison yard, a warden came up to her and told her that she had visitors. asma was brought into the visiting room and there, on the other side of the partition, for the first time in seven months, she saw her five children. she says she couldn't believe her eyes - 45 minutes of happiness. physicians for human rights had arranged the visit, after much strenuous effort. four of the children were given permits and one, 15-year-old imad, was not - for security reasons. but in the end, he also snuck in for the visit. after they all finished crying, she asked them the questions she had wanted to ask all those months. how things were at home and at school, and who was looking after them, and what they were eating. sajida and hamzi sat there speechless most of the time, hardly able to speak. for nine months, she slept on the floor. eight prisoners in a cell with six beds. asma was the last to be put in the cell and so she had to sleep on the floor, brain tumor or not. the prison service's new spokesman, ofer lefler, said this week: ""this is an administrative detainee (who was released on november 10, 2003), entitled by law to be kept separate from other prisoners and thus certainly entitled to a bed. at her request, the detainee was transferred to living quarters and kept with other security prisoners, despite the shortage of space in the prison system. therefore, she was forced to take turns sleeping on a mattress and not on a bed, as a result of an internal decision by the prisoners."" asma's second period of detention was subsequently shortened to three months. on the 10th of last month, she thought she was being released, but an officer told her that her release had been postponed again. but later that afternoon, when she had almost despaired, they came and told her to pack her things. with hands and feet bound, she was taken to one of the checkpoints near ramallah. at ten that night, she was sent on her way, into the dark night, far from her home. a palestinian passerby invited her to sleep at his house. from there, she called her children. ""i'm out!"" she told them. at six in the morning, she got up and started on the long way home from ramallah to jenin. she was on the road until two in the afternoon, having waited at checkpoints and resorted to circuitous dirt roads - an ailing woman finally on the way home to her children, after nine months in prison without trial. shooting children last week, this column told the story of the killing of three children from burqin and neighboring jenin one saturday in november. one of the children was ahmed zarouna, age 12. the idf spokesman said, ""the force fired toward a palestinian who climbed on an armored vehicle, apparently in order to steal a machine gun that was on it."" in order to justify the killing even further, the idf spokesman also said that 12-year-old ahmed was ""a hamas activist known to the security forces."" a reservist who served in jenin wrote to me the day after the article was","update","",9,TRUE

- urging that the us government live up to its claims to be supportive of the system of international human rights protection, by complying with the inter-american commission on human rights request of 27 january 2000, noting also that the european parliament has urged compliance with the iachr request and clemency for juan raul garza; - expressing concern at the racial disparities evident on federal death row, and asking what review has been undertaken to ensure that racial discrimination did not play a part in this sentencing pattern; - noting us claims to be a progressive force for human rights, and confirming, for example from your experience of media coverage in your country, that the use of the death penalty damages the image of the usa abroad, as acknowledged recently by the us ambassador to france; - expressing concern that the federal government, which should be offering human rights leadership to the country as a whole, is contemplating an execution at a time when the fairness and reliability of the us death penalty is the cause of widespread and growing concern; - urging president clinton not to become the first president since 1963 to allow a federal execution, but to grant clemency to juan raul garza and to impose an immediate moratorium on federal executions as a first step in leading the usa away from its use of this cruel and fallible punishment. appeals to: president bill clinton the white house office of the president 1600 pennsylvania avenue washington dc 20500","","2000-02-17",4,TRUE

a week later he recanted and implicated his brother and henry hunt. a.r. barnes was charged with conspiracy, and elwell barnes and henry hunt were charged with capital murder (elwell barnes was also sentenced to death, but died in prison in 2001 while awaiting a resentencing hearing). - in 1989 elwell barnes signed an affidavit that he (elwell barnes), his brother a.r. barnes, and others  but not henry hunt  committed both murders, and that henry hunt had nothing to do with either murder. - the state bureau of investigation and the lumberton police department destroyed files on the investigation of the case before henry hunts appeal lawyers were able to review them. - jerome ratleys account of the killing of larry jones conflicts with the physical evidence of that murder. two reconstruction experts recently concluded that the murder of larry jones could not have happened the way that jerome ratley related to the trial jury. - the prosecution withheld evidence that, in interviews with police, larry jones had not mentioned henry hunt in relation to jackie ransoms death; at the time, larry jones was implicating rogers locklear as the person responsible for the murder. this would tend to undermine the states theory of henry hunts motive for killing larry jones. - with the exception of the cigarette butt, no physical evidence links henry hunt to either murder. prosecutors introduced a shovel into evidence which they claimed henry hunt had used to bury one of the victims. the jury was left unaware that the soil on the shovel did not match the soil in which the victim had been buried. - initial witness statements conflicted with each other, and it was only as they changed over time that the discrepancies were eliminated. for example, bernice cummings, henry hunts former girlfriend, provided testimony that linked him to the murder weapon. she had initially told police that she knew nothing about a gun. in subsequent months, her account changed several times. another state witness, jim delton freeman, whose testimony also linked henry hunt to the murder weapon, also changed his account various times. many of the people who testified for the prosecution were either involved in the murders or had reason to deflect blame away from themselves. rogers locklear and dottie ransom, who admitted that they conceived and arranged jackie ransoms murder, pleaded guilty and served fewer than five years each in prison. a.r. barnes served less than eight years in prison for conspiracy to murder. jerome ratley was not charged. jim delton freeman was facing 10 to 15 years imprisonment on a parole violation at the time of henry hunts trial. after he testified, the parole violation charge against him was not pursued. henry lee hunt was previously the subject of extra 04/03 issued 15 january 2003. he was scheduled to be executed on 24 january 2003, but received a stay of execution just 35 hours before his scheduled execution. background information amnesty international is not in a position to know if henry lee hunt is guilty or innocent, and opposes his execution in any event. it notes, however, that the case displays some of the factors present in cases of wrongful conviction in other capital cases in the usa  such as prosecutorial withholding of evidence and the reliance on questionable accomplice testimony. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of jackie ransom and larry jones, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of their death or minimize the suffering caused; - opposing the execution of henry lee hunt, who is due to be executed on 12 september; - noting that he has consistently maintained his innocence of the murders, and that he has passed two lie detector tests administered by a renowned polygraph expert;

retributive killing is surely not the way to achieve these goals. a clear majority of countries  currently 111  have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. the international community has ruled out the death penalty as a sentencing option in international courts for even the worst crimes  genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. the usas continuing resort to this punishment, often in ways and cases which violate international minimum safeguards, starkly gives the lie to its claims to be a progressive force for human rights in the world. since resuming executions in 1977, 780 men and women have been put to death across the united states, more than 600 of them since 1990. texas accounts for 271 of these executions. sixty-three of these prisoners were prosecuted in a single county, harris county, where jeffery williams was also tried. fifteen of the 31 prisoners executed in the usa this year have been killed in texas. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of barbara pullins, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of her death; - execution of jeffery williams, and expressing deep concern at the number of executions in texas (you may use any anti death penalty arguments you wish); - expressing concern that his trial lawyers did not introduce available evidence supportive of a finding of less than capital murder;

in an apparent attempt to blunt the impact of this mitigating evidence. eddie hartmans aunt was also called to testify about the sexual abuse. cross-examining her about abuse the defendant suffered when he was 11 years old, the prosecutor said to the aunt: well, you knew that mr hartman is a homosexual. youve heard that. after the defense objected to this improper question, an objection which the judge sustained, the prosecutor persisted with his irrelevant and inflammatory line of questioning when he asked: did you know what sexual persuasion the defendant was? the jury sentenced eddie hartman to death. in post-conviction proceedings, asked about his line of questioning regarding eddie hartmans homosexuality and the abuse he had suffered as a young child, the prosecutor said that it seems to me that if someone is a practicing homosexual, that that may in some way  its a little bit different for someone being a practicing homosexual in his real life as opposed to someone who said he had been assaulted at some point in time. the united nations guidelines on the role of prosecutors requires that prosecutors perform their duties fairly, consistently and expeditiously, and respect and protect human dignity and uphold human rights, and  carry out their functions impartially and avoid all political, social, religious, racial, cultural, sexual or any other kind of discrimination. the right to freedom from discrimination on the basis of sex, which includes sexual orientation, is recognized in international treaties, including the international covenant on civil and political rights, which the usa ratified in 1992. eddie hartmans family background was abusive and dysfunctional. his mother, who gave birth to him when she was 17 years old, separated from eddies father when the boy was aged eight months, and he had no contact with his father until he was 18 years old. his mother married a total of six times. eddie hartman was beaten by three of the husbands. on one occasion, he was allegedly beaten with a club, leaving him unconscious, and in hospital for a week. he witnessed his mother being subjected to domestic violence, and also witnessed her attempt to commit suicide by taking an overdose and slashing her wrists. she and other relatives suffered from alcoholism, and eddie hartman began drinking around the age of 11 and subsequently became alcoholic himself. according to his current lawyers, at the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, eddie hartmans court-appointed counsel did not present the jury with evidence of diminished culpability due to a head injury he sustained and his mental health and substance abuse problems. the north carolina state bar recently suspended the law license of one of his trial lawyers. last year, the common sense foundation, a non-governmental body which promotes progressive public policy in north carolina, issued a study which found that one in six death row inmates in the state had been represented at trial by lawyers who have been disciplined by the state bar association, while less than one percent of all lawyers receive such disciplinary action. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty require that capital defendants receive adequate legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, and every execution is a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. this is a punishment which extends the suffering of one family  that of the murder victim  to another, that of the condemned prisoner. today 112 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast, the usa has put 875 men and women to death since resuming executions in 1977. the vast majority of these executions have been carried out in the past decade. there have been 55 executions in the usa so far this year. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of herman smith, explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of his death or to minimize the suffering it will have caused; - opposing the execution of eddie hartman; - expressing deep concern at the attempt by the prosecutor to use the defendants homosexuality against him at trial, and suggesting that it is impossible to know what effect this potentially inflammatory tactic had on the jury; - expressing concern that the trial lawyers failed to raise evidence of diminished culpability at the guilt phase of the trial; - noting that one of his defense lawyers has since been disciplined by the state bar association, further fuelling concern about the quality of trial representation for capital defendants in north carolina; - calling for clemency for eddie hartman in the interests of justice, decency, and the reputation of north carolina. appeals to: state governor: governor michael f. easley office of the governor 20301 mail service center raleigh, nc 27699","","",2,TRUE

death penalty / legal concern          10 june 2002 usa (georgia)          wallace marvin fugate wallace fugate, white, aged 52, is scheduled to be executed in georgia at 7pm local time on 18 june 2002. he was sentenced to death in 1992 for the murder of his former wife, pattie dianne fugate, in 1991. wallace and pattie fugate were divorced in 1990 after 20 years of marriage. at the time of her death, pattie fugate was living in the former marital home near eatonton in putnam county with their 15-year-old son, mark. on 4 may 1991, wallace fugate, who was living in another town, came to the eatonton house. later that day he shot pattie fugate. wallace fugates defense was that his gun had gone off accidentally as he and his former wife engaged in a physical struggle. however, mark fugate, who was murdered five years later in an unrelated case, testified at the trial that he had seen his father grab [pattie fugate], holding her by the hair, tilt her head back, put the gun in her face, and pull the trigger. the state-appointed defense lawyers did not bring to the attention of the jury mark fugates earlier statement to the police in which he had said: i heard a shot. i saw my mothers head hit the ground. i could not tell if he held her head back or not. this failure to raise the different pre-trial version of the killing in order to challenge the credibility of the states key witness is one of numerous instances where wallace fugates trial representation appears to have been inadequate. for example, the lawyers offered no objections during the two-day trial. they did not seek funding for any experts, such as an independent weapons expert who could have testified (as one did during post-conviction proceedings) that the brand of gun used in the shooting had a manufacturing defect which made it susceptible to accidental discharge. the defense position was even further undermined when, during closing arguments, one of the defense lawyers reportedly argued that the killing was accidental, and the other described it as self-defense. the whole sentencing phase of the trial lasted 64 minutes, its evidentiary portion less than half an hour. the defense presented four mitigation witnesses whose testimony covered only 20 pages of transcript. the lawyers did not do any investigation of wallace fugates medical, military, employment or school history in preparation for the sentencing. on appeal, affidavits were obtained from 13 potential character witnesses who indicated that they would have testified on wallace fugates behalf if asked. during post-conviction proceedings, one of the two trial lawyers recalled that they had shared the work on the case,  particularly on mitigation. he testified that they had divided contacting the potential witnesses between them. however, the other lawyer testified that he had not participated in contacting potential sentencing phase witnesses, and that his co-counsel had talked to whatever had to be talked to. during post-conviction proceedings one of the lawyers reportedly stated that he had heard of neither furman v georgia , the landmark us supreme court decision in 1972 which imposed a de facto moratorium on the death penalty in the usa, nor gregg v georgia , the equally momentous decision in 1976 which allowed executions to resume. background information to win an appeal on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a us prisoner must prove that not only was the trial lawyers performance inadequate, but that it had affected the outcome of the trial. under the us supreme court precedent, strickland v washington (1984), the judicial scrutiny of legal representation must be highly deferential and must indulge a strong presumption that counsel ;s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. in rejecting wallace fugates claim of inadequate trial counsel, the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit applied an arguably even higher standard, holding that in order to show that counsels performance was unreasonable, the petitioner must establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take. the 11th circuit was quoting its 2000 decision in chandler v united states , in which it upheld the death sentence of federal death row inmate david ronald chandler. chandler was convicted on the basis of testimony given by the actual killer, who later recanted. chandlers lawyer failed to conduct any sentencing phase investigation. the death sentence was subsequently commuted in january 2001 by president bill clinton in one of his last acts of office, because of doubts about chandlers guilt (extra 03/01 issued 12 january 2001 and update 22 january). when the 11th circuit upheld wallace fugates conviction and death sentence in august 2001, one of the three judges noted: i remain convinced that our court set the acceptable level of attorney assistance for preparation for the penalty phase of a capital case too low in chandler v united states. international safeguards require adequate legal representation for capital defendants at all stages of proceedings, above and beyond that provided in non-capital cases. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. it believes that every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, and every execution a symptom of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. since resuming executions in 1977, 780 men and women have been put to death across the usa. twenty-nine of these executions have been in georgia.

now i will have to live with this for the rest of my life. maybe this man was innocent. prior to his 1992 trial, cameron willingham had turned down a life prison sentence in return for a guilty plea because he said he was innocent. at the trial, the state presented evidence that he had confessed to another jail inmate that he had set the fire, and evidence that he had not tried hard enough to rescue his children. among the states scientific evidence of arson was that of crazed glass in the house. this was presented as an indicator that the fire had become especially hot as a result of an accelerant being applied. however, it has since been shown that crazed glass can be created as a result of hot glass being sprayed with water when the fire is being put out. the four experts called other aspects of the investigation into question. on 6 october 2004, ernest ray willis was released after 17 years on death row in texas. he was sentenced to death in 1987 for the 1986 murder of two women who died in a house fire that was ruled to have been arson. after a court granted willis a new trial in 2004, the county prosecutor hired an arson specialist to review the original evidence. the expert, one of those now saying that the willingham arson evidence is unsafe, concluded that there was no evidence of arson, and that the accelerant"" initially suspected of causing the fire was in fact ""flashover burning,"" consistent with electrical fault fires. the prosecutor dropped all charges, saying that willis ""simply did not do the crime i'm sorry this man was on death row for so long and that there were so many lost years."" texas accounts for 336 of the 944 executions carried out in the usa since 1977. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of guilt or innocence. since 1973, 117 people have been released from us death rows after evidence of their innocence emerged. others have gone to their deaths despite serious doubts about their guilt. further recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words, including willinghams former prisoner number #999041 in your appeals: - expressing deep regret at the execution of cameron willingham on 17 february 2004; - noting new evidence that cameron willingham was convicted on the basis of a seriously flawed fire investigation, and that four arson experts have concluded that the house fire could have been accidental; - noting the case of ernest willis, and that cameron willingham had consistently maintained his innocence, including in his final statement before being killed by the state; - calling for a full independent inquiry into this case, and for the results to be made public; - calling on the addressees to support a moratorium on executions in texas. appeals to: governor rick perry, office of the governor, po box 12428, austin, texas 78711-2428","update","2004-02-06",2,TRUE

every execution is a symptom of, not a solution to, a culture of violence. killing prisoners offers no constructive contribution to societys efforts to combat violent crime. like many condemned inmates in the usa, clifton white was exposed to violence and abuse from an early age. his mother, who was alcoholic, used to beat him with belts and brooms. he was also beaten by other adult relatives. his father was a suicidal drug addict, who used to steal to support his addiction. on one occasion, clifton white was present when his father threatened to shoot himself, putting a loaded gun to his head. when clifton white was six, he witnessed his uncle beating his mother. his grandfather shot the uncle in both knees to make him stop the beating. clifton white began to use drugs and alcohol, and to steal in order to support his habit. in his early 20's he was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, a condition which requires medication. he was in prison for burglary at the time, and was given the appropriate treatment. however, he was reportedly not properly advised of the need to continue taking the medication and, upon his release, he stopped taking it. he began self-medicating with cocaine, drug use that was apparently also fuelled by the trauma he had suffered in prison at the hands of an inmate who raped him. in the months before kimberly ewing was killed, clifton whites sister realized that her brother was losing control, and might be a risk to himself or others. she repeatedly contacted his probation officer, as well as a mental health centre and a magistrate, to ask for help. finally, the probation officer tried to find a drug rehabilitation program after meeting white, but nothing was available. two weeks after the meeting with the probation officer, clifton white killed his acquaintance kimberly ewing in what he described at trial as a crime committed in a frenzy and a passion and in a drug-induced, alcohol-induced kind of fury. shortly after the murder, clifton white was arrested in florida on an unrelated charge of breaking and entering. he voluntarily told the police that he had something to tell you thats driving me crazy, and he confessed to the murder. his remorse is said to be evident on the taped confession. others have said that he has been remorseful through the 12 years since the murder. he is reported to have been a model inmate on death row, and to have committed no acts of violence. clifton white said at his trial: i accept responsibility. it is my fault that there is a mother and father that dont have their daughter. i accept full responsibility. it was because of me. he expressed his remorse: i feel bad. i feel bad because it is my fault. this mother and father dont have a daughter and it is my fault. it bothers me just to think about it. it is something that never leaves my mind. it will be with me for the rest of my life. background information executions in north carolina have been put on hold recently while the state supreme court considers the claim that governor mike easley cannot be an impartial arbiter of clemency petitions because, in his previous role as attorney general, he had fought the appeals of scores of condemned inmates who challenged their death sentences. prior to being attorney general, he was a prosecutor who sought the death penalty. the court has not yet ruled on the case. the next rulings by the court are due on 17 august, although it is not known if the decision on this issue will be handed down then. if the court does rule on 17 august, and rules against the state, the execution of clifton white and others would be stayed. if it disagrees that the governor has a conflict of interest, the way would be cleared for executions to go ahead. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 725 men and women have been put to death in 31 states. north carolina accounts for 17 of these executions. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of kimberly ewing;

october 2003 usa (georgia)     james willie brown james willie brown (m), white, aged 55, is scheduled for execution in georgia on 4 november. he was sentenced to death at a retrial in 1990 for the rape and murder of brenda watson in 1975. he has a clemency hearing in front of the state parole board on 31 october. it is not known when the board will make its decision. james brown has a long history of mental illness, which has included repeated diagnoses of schizophrenia. at the age of 15, he was diagnosed as suffering from convulsive disorder and prescribed medication to control his seizures. by the age of 17 he had entered the army but served less than two years before eventually being discharged due to his mental illness. as his situation deteriorated, he began to use illegal drugs, and was arrested for the first time in 1968, when he was about 20 years old. he was deemed incompetent to stand trial; that is, that he lacked the mental capacity to fully understand the proceedings or assist in his defence. he was therefore sent to a state mental facility. between the time of his first arrest and his 1981 trial for the murder of brenda watson, he was in mental facilities for 70 per cent of the time, both on an involuntary and voluntary basis. his trial for murder was delayed for six years on the grounds of mental incompetence. he was eventually tried and sentenced to death in 1981, but was granted a new trial by a federal court in 1988 due to doubts over his competency to stand trial in 1981. he was retried in 1990, and again sentenced to death. at the retrial, the defence presented two experts who testified that james brown suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia. in a subsequent affidavit, given in 1994, one of these experts stated: mr browns medical history establishes that his mental illness was of a long standing nature... from mr browns post-arrest hospitalization in june 1975 until shortly before his original trial in january 1981, mr brown was under almost constant supervision by mental health professionals at central state hospital. the affidavit continues: considering the type of illness, his extensive medical history and my examination of mr brown, it was my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that mr brown was psychotic at the time of the alleged offense and that he acted upon delusions and therefore, could not distinguish between right and wrong at the time. based upon my recent review of the additional materials, i stand by my original diagnosis and this opinion. in addition, two inmates who were in the county jail at the time of james browns arrest gave post-conviction affidavits that describe how he was out of touch with reality and psychotic. the states position at the 1990 retrial, however, was that james brown was faking his mental illness. it presented a doctor who stated that, in his opinion, the defendant did not have schizophrenia, but had suffered drug-induced flashbacks. this doctor appears to have ignored james browns long history and repeated diagnoses of mental illness (over the years more than 25 mental health experts employed by the state have found james brown to be mentally ill and not malingering). moreover, in closing arguments, the prosecutor stated to the jury: that brings us to the question that [the defence lawyer] wanted you to consider, should we put the mentally ill to death. well, i dont know the answer to that question... and you don t have to decide that question in this case. because, ladies and gentlemen, this man isnt mentally ill, he has never been mentally ill, and he is not mentally ill today. he was not mentally ill on the [day of the crime]. to bolster the states theory that the defendant was malingering, the prosecution presented a former inmate, anita tucker, who said that james brown had confided in her that he was faking his illness. anita tucker has now recanted that testimony, and testified that her earlier testimony was part of a deal with the prosecution in exchange for her early release on her own criminal charges. like many on death row in the usa, james willie brown comes from a background of poverty, deprivation and serious abuse. according to a 1994 affidavit given by a clinical psychologist, james brown was born in 1948 to a 15-year-old mother and an alcoholic father. theirs was one of the poorest families in a low-income neighbourhood. the children were subjected to routine physical abuse, principally by the father. according to the psychologist:  instruments of abuse included belts, boards, branches, cords, and fists, and the children were also kicked. in addition to beatings of the children, the father also often brutally beat the mother with his fists in front of the children. when [james brown] attempted to aid his mother while she was being beaten, he only earned himself yet another beating from his father... according to [james brown], his brothers and his mother, the fathers beatings were extremely severe, leaving welts, drawing blood, and even, in [his] case, causing unconsciousness. the father not only beat [him] at home but also did so in public, in front of friends and family, and [james brown] reports that the father appeared to take great pride and pleasure in humiliating him like this. the united nations commission for human rights has repeatedly passed resolutions calling for an end to the use of the death penalty against anyone with any form of mental disorder. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. while 112 countries are abolitionist in law or practice, the usa has put 878 prisoners to death since resuming executions in 1977, including 58 this year. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of brenda watson, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of her death or to minimize the suffering caused; - noting that james willie brown has a long history of serious mental illness stemming long before the crime, and that his illness has been recognized by the state on numerous occasions, including when he was in the military and the state hospital; - expressing concern that the prosecution argued to the jury that he had never been mentally ill, and noting that the former inmate who testified at trial that james willie brown was faking his mental illness has since recanted her testimony; - urging clemency for james willie brown in the interest of decency and the reputation of georgia. appeals to: georgia board of pardons and paroles 2 martin luther king, jr. drive, se, suite 458, balcony level, east tower atlanta, georgia 30334-4909","","",2,TRUE

- calling for the arbitrary and massive use of the death penalty in china to be stopped; - urging the chinese government to exclude non-violent crimes from the scope of the death penalty, as recommended by the united nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions;

""i have thoroughly and carefully reviewed the records in this case. i believe colvin-el committed this horrible crime. but i do not have the same level of absolute certainty i had with the other two cases. it is not appropriate to proceed with an execution when there is any level of uncertainty, as the death penalty is final and irreversible. therefore, i have commuted his sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole... pressure on the governor to stop the execution had mounted in recent weeks. on 1 june, in an unusual move, marylands three catholic bishops held a press conference to call for clemency. on 6 june, black state legislators placed an advertisement in the baltimore sun calling for a moratorium on executions because of all the uncertainties and racial disparities revealed about the implementation of the death penalty. eugene colvin-el is a black man convicted by an all-white jury on limited circumstantial evidence of killing a white woman (see original extra). a spokesman said that the governor had received more letters and calls than for previous maryland executions, with the majority favouring clemency. the baltimore sun noted international concern about the case, for example quoting from an appeal from the austrian capital, vienna, and noting amnesty internationals involvement. in a letter dated 30 may, pope john paul ii made his first appeal for clemency in a maryland case. the maryland abolitionist movement has reported greater attendance at rallies and meetings, with local awareness fueled by growing national concern about the fairness and reliability of the us capital justice system. the washington post noted: glendening's decision to issue the clemency order arrived just as the nation has become embroiled in debate over how death penalties are being meted out. amid the widening concern that innocent people are being sent to death row, gov. james ryan halted executions in illinois in january, and last week, texas gov. george w. bush ordered an execution delayed for 30 days to allow new dna testing. (see update to ua 139/00, 2 june). reaction in maryland to the commutation has been mixed. relatives of the murder victim, lena buckman, who had been campaigning for the execution, expressed their anger. her 70-year-old son blamed the decision on political pressure and mob rule. the senate president disagreed with the decision, reportedly saying: i think its a mistake. the governors decision undermines the jury system. i just have this terrible empathy for the children and grandchildren of the victim. another legislator, however, whilst expressing sympathy for the relatives, welcomed the","","",3,TRUE

retributive killing is surely not the way to achieve these goals. a clear majority of countries  currently 111  have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. since mississippi last carried out an execution -- that of leo edwards on 21 june 1989 -- over 40 countries have legislated against the death penalty. furthermore, the international community has ruled out the death penalty as a sentencing option in international courts for even the worst crimes  genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. since executions resumed in the usa in 1977, 784 men and women have been put to death, more than 500 of them since 1995. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of officer bruce ladner, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of his death or to minimize the suffering it will have caused; - expressing concern that the jury which sentenced tracy hansen to death was left unaware of substantial mitigating evidence about his background of abuse and his mental impairment; - noting that three of the trial jurors have indicated that they would not have voted for death if they had been presented with this evidence;

supreme court lifted the stay of execution it granted shortly before he was due to be killed on 10 december. sentenced to death in 1990 for the murder of gilbert hooks in 1987, kevin zimmerman is now due to be put to death on 21 january 2004. in late september 1987, kevin zimmerman was released from prison in his native louisiana after serving a three-year sentence for possession of drugs. after he returned home to find that his wife was having an affair with his best friend, he embarked on an alcohol and drug binge with other friends. on the fifth day of this spree, 23 october, kevin zimmerman and two friends were drinking in a motel room in beaumont, texas, when they were joined by fellow motel guest, 33-year-old gilbert hooks. later that night, zimmerman and hooks got into an argument, and hooks stabbed zimmerman in the arm, causing him to bleed profusely. their fight continued and ended in hooks being stabbed to death. kevin zimmerman was charged with murder, not capital murder. he was appointed a succession of lawyers who all withdrew from the case for various reasons, having done little or no work on the case. after a year, zimmerman wrote letters to the prosecutor and court, in effect daring them to charge him with capital murder. in his letters he falsely claimed involvement in other crimes, and claimed that he had robbed hooks. murder during the course of a robbery is a capital offence, unlike plain murder. he was recharged, this time with capital murder. a doctor who recently reviewed the case has stated in an affidavit that the claims in zimmermans letters were patently absurd and that the records indicate that at the time he was  psychotic, potentially suicidal and required suicide prevention measures. in july 1989, kevin zimmerman was appointed the lawyer who would represent him at his capital trial, his fifth attorney since he was first charged. she had no experience in capital cases and had never represented anyone charged with murder. she chose co-counsel who had no capital case experience. the lawyers failed to have zimmerman evaluated for his mental competency to stand trial even though there was evidence that he might not be able to assist in his own defense. they did not investigate his family background, and did not learn that he had a history of mental problems beginning after a serious bicycle accident at the age of 11, as a result of which he had a plate put in his head. there were numerous relatives and neighbors who could have testified that his personality and behavior changed after the accident. the lawyers failed to present expert psychiatric evidence to support the claim of self-defense or to present as mitigation evidence against the death penalty. since the trial a number of experts have concluded that kevin zimmermans brain injury had affected his behavior, including at the time of the stabbing. in 2003, for example, a psychologist concluded that because of this, the crime should not be considered as a predatory/premeditated crime (see original extra). kevin zimmerman faces lethal injection with three chemicals: sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. pancuronium bromide, a derivative of curare, paralyzes the skeletal muscles but does not affect the brain or nerves. a person injected with it remains conscious but cannot move or speak. legal challenges are being made against its use in executions on the grounds that it may throw a chemical veil over the reality of lethal injections by masking suffering and giving the false appearance of a serene death. in a challenge in tennessee, a woman testified that she had undergone surgery during which the anaesthetic failed. she testified that she was able to hear, perceive and feel everything that was going on in her surgery, but was unable to move or speak because of an injection of pancuronium bromide. she has described the experience as worse than death. the use of pancuronium bromide for pet euthanasia is not acceptable under american veterinary medical association guidelines, and its use has been banned in several states. on 1 september 2003, a new law came into force in texas banning its use in the euthanasia of cats and dogs. the american medical association's code of ethics prohibits doctors from participating in executions. there are reportedly no standards for the training of these non-medical personnel who carry out texas executions, increasing the potential for botched executions. according to kevin zimmermans lawyers, a law which will come into force on 1 january 2005 ""would make the lethal injection process, if performed on animals, illegal, because of the lack of training for the personnel involved, and the lack of safeguards. kevin zimmermans execution was stopped by the us supreme court about 20 minutes before it was due to be carried out on 10 december. lawyers had asked for a stay of execution in a civil rights lawsuit challenging the lethal injection process. the lower courts had dismissed the appeal by recharacterizing it as a procedurally barred successive habeas corpus petition under a different law (see extra update). in december, in the case of david nelson, an alabama inmate challenging his impending lethal injection on the grounds that he has collapsed veins and would have to face painful surgery before being killed, the supreme court agreed to consider the question of courts reconstruing civil rights suits as habeas corpus petitions. on 15 december, the supreme court lifted kevin zimmermans stay of execution, however. four of the nine justices dissented, holding that his case should await the outcome of the nelson case. the five justices in the majority gave no reason for lifting the stay. on 18 de cember, the court upheld a stay of execution for virginia inmate james reid pending its decision in the alabama case. reid has raised a similar complaint to david nelson. prior to kevin zimmermans 10 december execution date, the texas board of pardons and paroles denied clemency although, unusually, two members voted for commutation, at least one of whom did not consider the case to have warranted the death penalty. the governor does not have the power to commute without a recommendation from the board, but he does have the authority to issue a reprieve. further recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words, using the above information as you see fit: - explaining that you are not seeking to minimize the seriousness of gilbert hooks killing, or the suffering it has caused; - noting that the prosecution did not initially consider this to be a case of capital murder, and only upgraded it after an intervention by the defendant who was in an apparently psychotic or suicidal state; - expressing concern at the poor quality of kevin zimmermans trial counsel, who failed to present expert evidence of the defendants mental impairment; - noting that since the trial a number of experts have concluded that this mental impairment made it unlikely that the crime was premeditated or that the defendant could conform his conduct to the law; - expressing concern that texas has executed more than 300 prisoners by a method which evidence suggests could be resulting in torturous deaths where the suffering is masked, and noting that animals could not be euthanized under this method under various states laws, including in texas; - calling on the governor to stop kevin zimmermans execution and to ask the board of pardons and

paramilitary gunmen, backed by the army, are continuing to threaten forcibly displaced communities who have returned to their lands in the departments of choc and antioquia unless they once again abandon the region. some of the returning displaced communities have declared themselves to be peace communities as a means to call on the two sides in the conflict to respect their right to life as civilians and to respect their right not to be drawn into the conflict. most recently the comunidad de paz de natividad de mara, peace community of natividad de mara has come under attack. on 2 august, a group of between 100 and 200 paramilitaries reportedly entered the hamlet of bocas de curbarad (mouth of the river curbarad), department of choc, which is part of the peace community of natividad de mara. the gunmen rounded up the inhabitants and accused them of being guerilla sympathisers, and threatened to kill them. according to information received, the day before the paramilitaries arrived, peasant farmer orfides flores had gone out to gather food for his family, and had not returned. police removed a mutilated body, believed to be his, from the atrato river on 3 august. on 14 july, members of local non-governmental organizations (ngos) who work with the peace communities travelling with international delegates by boat from the community of cao claro, which is on a tributary of the curbarad river were forced to stop by paramilitary gunmen of the autodefensas de colombia (auc), united self-defence forces of colombia. the paramilitaries reportedly ordered 53 members of the community who were travelling with the delegation aside and threatened them ordering them to abandon their lands. these events have raised concerns for the safety of all the peace communities in the department of choc and the returned communities of the cacarica river basin. there is reported to be a continued strong paramilitary presence to the south of the cacarica river basin and in late june paramilitaries reportedly threatened civilian communities of the salaqu river basin that they intended to take this land from them. it is of concern that despite national and international denunciations the armed forces have taken no decisive action to confront the paramilitaries despite the fact that the atrato river is heavily-miltarized. concerns for the peace communities have been heightened by a further paramilitary incursion against the peace community of san jos de apartad. on 30 july, the community of la unin fled to san jos de apartad after paramilitaries threatened to kill the villagers who refused to collaborate with them, if they did not leave the area. a boy who tried to escape after being dragged from his home was killed. the 63 families of la unin are planning to return to their lands on 23 august. amnesty international believes they will face further attacks once they have returned and fears for their safety. the returned displaced communities of choc and the community of san jos de apartad have frequently been labelled guerrilla collaborators by the security forces and their paramilitary proxies since they live in areas where the left-wing armed opposition group fuerzas armadas revolucionaroas de colombia (farc), revolutionary armed forces of colombia, maintain a strong presence. forces of the armed opposition group ejrcito de liberacin nacional (eln), national liberation army, also maintain a strong presence in the choc. these accusations have frequently been followed by serious human rights violations committed by the security forces and their paramilitary auxiliaries. guerrilla forces for their part have frequently accused members of the returned displaced communities of collaborating with the security forces and their paramilitary allies and have refused to respect the communities demand that they should not be drawn into the conflict. guerrilla forces have been responsible for death threats and the arbitrary and deliberate killing of members of the peace communities they accuse of collaborating with the security forces and their paramilitary allies. further recommended action: please send telegrams/telexes/faxes/express/ airmail letters: - calling for a full and impartial investigation into the paramilitary incursion into bocas de curbarad on 2 august, when the gunmen threatened to kill members of the peace community of natividad de mara;

so-called future dangerousness. before the shooting, javier surez had no criminal record. the defence presented 15 witnesses who testified to his non-violent character. the prosecution had little or no evidence to give to the jury that javier surez would pose a danger if allowed to live. it presented alleged instances of school disobedience, and of an occurrence of joyriding with others in a stolen car. however, after both sides had concluded their presentations, the state produced a surprise witness who had just come forward. while watching the trial coverage on television, michael mesley said he had recognized javier surez as the man who had shot him in the face in a 1987 night time robbery. he was allowed to testify, over the objections of the defence. the defence was given only days to confront this dramatic testimony which the state used to argue future dangerousness. they produced javier surezs employment records showing that he had worked until two hours after michael mesley had been shot. however, the prosecution implied that he could have arranged for a fellow employee to punch his time card, thus allowing him to leave early. javier surez maintains that he did not shoot michael mesley. no physical evidence links him to that crime, which remains unsolved, and post-conviction investigations have undermined the states theory that a colleague could have covered for his absence at work. in addition, an expert has concluded that mesleys positive identification is unreliable, since it is based on a brief view of the robber's face under poor lighting and highly stressful circumstances. in many us states outside texas, javier surezs death sentence would have been overturned on appeal because the prosecutions introduction of this unadjudicated evidence would have been illegal. use of such testimony to support a death sentence has also been found to violate international law. in 2001, federal death row prisoner juan raul garza was executed despite a call for commutation by the inter-american commission on human rights (iachr). the iachr had found that the introduction of evidence of garzas involvement in unsolved crimes for which he had never been tried or convicted had been antithetical to the most basic and fundamental judicial guarantees. it concluded that garza had been sentenced to death in an arbitrary and capricious manner and that his execution would be a deliberate and egregious violation of us obligations under international law (see extra 29/01, amr 51/074/2001, 23 may 2001). javier surez has appealed to the iachr, which is expected to issue precautionary measures, that is, to call for a stay of execution while it considers the case. despite knowing from the outset that javier surez was a mexican national, the texas authorities never informed him of his right, under the vienna convention on consular relations, to contact his consulate for assistance. around 100 foreign nationals are on death row in the usa, the majority of whom were denied their consular rights, in violation of international law. in june 2001, the international court of justice found that the usa had breached its vienna convention obligations in the case of two german nationals, and must allow review and reconsideration of similar cases. with the assistance of the mexican government, javier surezs appeal lawyers have uncovered powerful mitigating evidence not heard by the jury. the new evidence includes a diagnosis that javier suarez suffers from significant mental impairments, including post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) as a result of traumatic events and abuse during his childhood and adolescence. in his late teens, he witnessed at close quarters the drive-by shooting of an acquaintance at a party. a psychological expert has concluded that javier surezs mental impairments affected his behaviour at the time of the crime. he further concludes that javier surezs description of having fired at cadena because he heard loud noises that he thought were gunshots is consistent with an exaggerated acoustic startle response, one of the classic symptoms of ptsd. the introduction of this evidence at the trial could have persuaded the jury that javier surez had not acted deliberately, a necessary requirement for the imposition of a death sentence in texas. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of lawrence rudy cadena; - expressing concern at the states use of unadjudicated evidence to secure a death sentence, illegal in many us states and under international law; -

so-called future dangerousness. the state presented evidence of t.j. joness short juvenile burglary and vandalism record. it also presented detailed evidence of the smith county shooting, including testimony from the victim. the state presented a psychologist who testified that t.j. jones was a future danger. he had, however, never spoken to or examined the defendant. in contrast to a 1982 us supreme court opinion that chronological age of a minor is itself a relevant mitigating factor of great weight, the expert testified that t.j. joness young age was an aggravating factor. he also stated that his lack of education and consequent lack of job skills made him likely to commit future acts of criminal violence. the defence presented a psychologist who had interviewed and tested t.j. jones over several visits. he found that t.j. jones had an iq of 78, in the borderline retardation range, and had begun using drugs and alcohol at age 13, his continuing use of which exacerbated his grossly poor judgment. the psychologist found that t.j. jones was typically a very passive person and had the emotional and psychological maturity of a 10 to 12 year old. the expert stated: a person at 17, particularly a person who is this immature cannot, should not be judged, i think, on the same basis that you would judge a 25 or 30-year-old. and the reason is simple. development is still taking place in this boy. and we really dont know whats in his future in terms of final and completed development. he also stated that t.j. jones could now be offered rehabilitative treatment, as he could have been if the authorities had offered appropriate intervention when he had come into contact with the juvenile justice system as a younger teenager. not long before the shootings, t.j. jones had been living in a house used by alleged gang members, who had access to guns and were allegedly involved in criminal violence. t.j. jones was the youngest male in the house. the gun used in both offences was given to him by one of the others in the house, a 22-year-old, who allegedly participated in the smith county robbery and the planning of both crimes. two other older male teenagers and a 17-year-old female were also involved in the gregg county crime. various relatives testified on t.j. jones behalf at the trial. his 16-year-old girlfriend, who two months earlier had given birth to their daughter, suggested that peer pressure lay behind the crimes. his grandfather stated that t.j. jones had always been a follower. his mother testified about the beatings she had been subjected to by his father, including when she was pregnant with tj. they separated when tj was a baby. she lived with another man for about two years when tj was about 11 to 12. his violence against her, witnessed by tj, caused him evident distress. she testified that she had sought official help with her son when he quit school at 15 and began to stay away from home, but to no avail. the unequivocal international prohibition on the death penalty for people under 18 years old at the time of the crime is enshrined in the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) and the convention on the rights of the child, the latter ratified by all countries except the usa and somalia. the prohibition stems from the recognition of a young persons immaturity, impulsiveness, vulnerability to peer pressure, and capacity for rehabilitation. since 1998, there have been 15 executions of child offenders documented worldwide, 10 in the usa (six in texas). t.j. jones has asked his lawyer not to seek clemency or any further appeals. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: to all addressees: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of willard lewis davis, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of his death; - expressing deep concern that texas is intending to kill t.j. jones, in violation of the fundamental principle of international law prohibiting the death penalty for people who were under 18 at the time of the crime; - pointing out that this prohibition, respected across the globe, stems from a recognition of a young persons immaturity and capacity for change; - noting expert evidence that t.j. jones was a particularly immature teenager, that he had an iq of 78, was involved with older people who provided the gun used in the crimes, and that his mother had sought state help. to the gregg county officials: - calling on them to take a stand against this violation of international law originating in their county and to ask the board of pardons and paroles to consider the case and recommend that the governor commute the sentence; to the governor: -

kathryn harrison. the murderer had used a plastic tie wrap to strangle kathryn harrison in her office in montgomery county on 22 january 1996. her ankles had been bound with a similar tie wrap, and her wrists bound by red electrical wire. richard kutzner was sentenced to death in september 1997. the state presented strong circumstantial evidence against him, including samples of red wire and plastic ties of the sort used in the murder which had been found in kutzners house and truck. there was also evidence indicating that kutzner had been in possession of a videocassette recorder and computer keyboard similar to ones taken from the murder scene. also presented was a note in harrisons handwriting, dated a few days before the murder, possibly pointing to kutzner as a potential client. kathryn harrisons husband had been the initial focus of the investigation. there was evidence of his abusive conduct towards her and that she had feared that he might kill her. a car of the type and color driven by her husband was seen outside the office around the time of the murder. kathryn harrison used to record telephone conversations with him at the office. at the time of her death, kathryn harrison had been gathering evidence of his infidelity. the recording device was missing from the murder scene. it was found in her husbands vehicle two weeks after the murder, yet it had not been there a week earlier when police had searched the vehicle. her husband said that he could not remember where he had obtained it. police focus shifted to two other men, roy landry and richard kutzner, after they were identified as suspects in a murder that had occurred two weeks before the harrison killing. richard kutzner was also sentenced to death for this murder, that of rita sheron van huss, who was killed in her office in houston in similar circumstances to kathryn harrison. he is still appealing against the death sentence he received for that murder. landry agreed to testify against kutzner in the harrison case after he, landry, was threatened with a capital murder charge. richard kutzner has consistently maintained his innocence of the murder of kathryn harrison. he came within 24 hours of execution in july 2001. the texas court of criminal appeals granted a stay to allow consideration of his request to have dna analysis done on fingernail scrapings from the victim and hair evidence from the crime scene, on the grounds that it could implicate someone else as the perpetrator. this was the first attempt by a texas death row prisoner to use a new state law, which came into effect on 5 april 2001, allowing inmates state-paid dna testing where such testing could affect the outcome of the case. the trial court and the court of criminal appeals subsequently denied kutzners motion to have the evidence tested, ruling that it would not have affected the outcome of the trial. in addition to commutation, richard kutzner is requesting a 120-day reprieve so that dna testing of the physical evidence can be carried out. background information amnesty international does not know whether richard kutzner is guilty or innocent of the murder of kathryn harrison, but opposes his execution in any event, as it opposes all use of the death penalty. the organization believes that every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, and every execution a symptom of, not a solution to, a culture of violence. international safeguards hold that those countries which still retain the death penalty must not carry it out against anyone whose guilt is in any doubt, specifically where there is any room for an alternative explanation of the facts. as an abolitionist organization, amnesty international is calling for commutation of richard kutzners death sentence regardless of his guilt or innocence. it submits that under this minimum safeguard, texas should, at a minimum, grant his request for a reprieve to allow dna testing to be carried out. more than 100 people have been released from death rows in the usa since 1973 after evidence of their innocence emerged. in 12 cases, dna testing played a substantial role in the prisoners exoneration. in other cases, dna testing has implicated capital suspects or has failed to exonerate already condemned inmates. for example, on 1 june 2000, 20 minutes before he was due to be executed, ricky mcginn was granted a reprieve to allow dna testing in his case. during presidential campaigning a few days earlier, then governor george w. bush said that he supported dna testing if it helps to settle a case, or erase any doubts or concerns. mcginn was executed on 27 september 2000 after the testing did not exonerate him. since executions resumed in the usa in 1977, 786 prisoners have been put to death. texas accounts for 274 of these killings. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words; - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of kathryn harrison, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of her death; - opposing the execution of richard kutzner; - noting that he has requested dna testing of physical

sometimes using electric cords and sticks. the texas court of criminal appeals then appointed a lawyer to represent toronto patterson for his appeals. this lawyer had never handled such an appeal. the one he filed for toronto patterson was six pages long. such appeals filed by adequately funded, experienced lawyers can be expected to run to 150 pages because of the number of issues raised and the complexity of the law. toronto pattersons appeal did not challenge his trial lawyers failure to investigate and present the above mitigating issues. because they were not raised in the state courts, such issues have been lost to review by the federal courts. background information toronto patterson was born less than two weeks after the usa signed the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) in 1977, and he was sentenced to death three years after the usa ratified the treaty in 1992. article 6(5) prohibits the use of the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime; a prohibition which stems from recognition of a young persons immaturity, impulsiveness, vulnerability to peer pressure, and capacity for rehabilitation. since 1990, the convention on the rights of the child, which carries the same prohibition, has been ratified by 191 countries; all but the usa and somalia. when the usa ratified the iccpr, it filed a reservation purporting to exempt it from the prohibition on the execution on child offenders. the human rights committee, the expert body established by the iccpr to oversee implementation of the treaty, has stated that the reservation is invalid and should be withdrawn. it has confirmed that the prohibition cannot be derogated from, even in times of emergency, and has deplored the usas continuing execution of child offenders. since 1998, there have been 15 executions of child offenders documented worldwide, 10 in the usa (six in texas). yemen and pakistan, two of the six other countries reported to have executed child offenders since 1990, have since abolished such use of the death penalty. it was recently reported that 74 child offenders who had remained on death row in pakistan have had their death sentences commuted. another of the six countries, democratic republic of congo, commuted the death sentences of five child offenders in 2001. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: to all addressees: - acknowledging the seriousness of the crime, and the suffering it will have caused; - expressing deep concern that texas is intending to execute toronto patterson, in violation of international law prohibiting the death penalty for people who were under 18 at the time of the crime; - pointing out that this prohibition, respected across the globe, stems from a recognition of a young persons immaturity and capacity for change; - noting residual doubt about his guilt, point out that international safeguards require that no death sentence be carried out if there is any  room for an alternative explanation of the facts; - expressing concern that the jury were not presented with evidence about the mitigating effect of youth and of substantial mitigating evidence of toronto pattersons abusive childhood, and that these issues have been lost to federal review due to the failings of his inexperienced state-appointed appeal lawyer;

iraqi asylum seekers in the united states aiusa concerns: amnesty international usa is concerned that iraqi asylum seekers in the united states be provided a full opportunity to present their asylum claims and that their applications are adjudicated in a timely manner. under present circumstances in iraq, aiusa is also concerned that no iraqis be forcibly returned to iraq until an objective assessment of conditions concludes that a safe, dignified and sustainable return in accordance with international standards is possible. finally, aiusa opposes the mandatory detention of insufficiently documented asylum seekers arriving in the united states. no suspension of iraqi asylum adjudications and no forced returns at the present time in a letter dated 2 april 2003, the regional representative of the un high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) in the united states wrote to u.s. authorities responsible for asylum, calling on them to designate iraqi nationals in the united states for temporary protected status (tps). unhcr also said, understanding the procedural complexities of tps and its limited application in the united states, where such temporary form of protection is not available, unhcr recommends that adjudicators continue to consider asylum claims on an individual basis. the unhcr branch office in washington also called on the u.s. authorities to consider granting asylum to iraqis whose cases have been pending for protracted periods and for individuals who have suffered severe forms of persecution in the past. amnesty international usa supports unhcrs position that the u.s. authorities should continue adjudicating iraqi asylum claims on an individual basis and should not return any iraqis involuntarily at the present time. some countries, including the united kingdom, denmark, norway, sweden, and switzerland have suspended decision-making on claims from iraqi nationals. aiusa considers it premature to suggest that the rapid changes that are taking place in iraq will be fundamental, effective and durable, thereby removing a continuing need for protection. therefore, applications for asylum should not be frozen or otherwise delayed either in anticipation of or with the expectation that, changes have or will have taken place that would establish that there is no ongoing need for protection. one of the arguments that at least some states have been putting forward to justify processing freezes is that the situation in iraq is in such a state of flux, that it is currently not possible to make decisions on refugee claims. amnesty international considers that this argument should be strenuously resisted, as it points to a preference on the part of states to deny rather than grant protection. states should recognise that a state of flux is a common feature of the majority of refugee situations, and it would be extraordinary if this were to constitute a valid ground to freeze or otherwise delay decision-making. a prospective assessment of risk is still possible in such circumstances, so refugee status (as well as complementary forms of protection) can still be granted. mandatory detention the new department of homeland security (dhs) announced on march 17 that it would automatically detain improperly documented asylum seekers arriving from iraq and other countries, for the duration of their processing period. these asylum seekerspeople seeking refuge from persecution in their home countriescould spend months or years in detention, while their claims are pending. before the new asylum modifications announced as part of  operation liberty shield, immigration authorities had the power to deny release to anyone they suspected might pose a danger to the public. now, there will be no such discretion to make an individualized parole assessment. under the new policy, asylum seekers from iraq and a long list of unnamed countries will be detained simply because of their nationality not because the authorities have any evidence that the asylum seeker individually poses any danger. blanket detention of asylum seekers contravenes international refugee norms, which hold that asylum seekers normally should not be detained, and is justified only in limited cases prescribed by law. the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) prohibits arbitrary detention, and requires that detained persons be permitted, without delay, to challenge the lawfulness of their detention and to seek release before a court. governments, in turn, have the burden of showing the necessity for detention in prompt and fair individualized hearings. recommended actions: please send appeals in your own words as quickly as possible to secretary of homeland security tom ridge, to president bush, and to your members of congress, calling upon them to: lift the mandatory detention policy for improperly documented iraqi and other asylum-seekers, as thismay operate as a deterrent to prevent iraqis and members of other unnamed nationalities from seeking asylum in the united states; ensure that iraqi asylum-seekers have access to full, fair, and timely asylum procedure for determining their claims for protection in the united states; ensure that iraqi applications for asylum are not frozen either in anticipation of, or in the expectation that, changes have or will have taken place that would establish that there is no ongoing need for protection; urge the u.s. government not to forcibly return iraqis to any part of iraq unless they have had access to a fair and satisfactory asylum procedure; and until an objective assessment of conditions concludes that a safe, dignified and sustainable return in accordance with international standards is possible. appeals

three in iran, two in pakistan, one in nigeria, one in democratic republic of congo (drc), and one in yemen. yemen and pakistan have now legislated to abolish such use of the death penalty. it was recently reported that 74 child offenders who had remained on death row in pakistan had had their death sentences commuted. in 2001, the death sentences of five child offenders in drc were commuted and there is currently a moratorium on executions there. china, which accounts for most of the worlds executions each year, nevertheless in 1997 abolished the use of the death penalty against defendants who were under 18 years old at the time of the crime. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of questions of guilt or innocence, the seriousness of the crime, the existence or absence of mitigating evidence, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. the organization believes that every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, and every execution a symptom of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. a clear majority of countries  currently 111  have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. the international community has ruled out the death penalty as a sentencing option in international courts for even the worst crimes  genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - acknowledging the seriousness of the crime and the suffering it will have caused, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner in which hope denise hall died; - expressing concern that the commonwealth attorneys office intends to seek another death sentence against shermaine johnson in violation of international law respected in almost every country of the world; - pointing to the immense damage being done to the international reputation of the united states by its continuing resort to this use of the death penalty in the face of an overwhelming global consensus against such use; -

lott could have cut his hair after the crime; and he could have worn make-up to lighten his skin. it is not clear whether the federal courts will review this decision. after the us supreme court ruled on 20 june 2002 in atkins v virginia that the execution of people with mental retardation is unconstitutional, the ohio department of corrections turned over records showing that it had assessed gregory lotts iq at 72 in 1986. this could indicate possible mental retardation, and lotts lawyers are asking for the execution to be stayed while the state establishes procedures for determining which inmates are protected by the atkins ruling. the prosecution continues to pursue lotts execution, arguing that he does not have mental retardation, and that an iq test before the trial had placed his iq at 86. international safeguards not only oppose the use of the death penalty against people with mental retardation, but also require that capital defendants receive adequate legal representation at all stages of the proceedings, and that the death penalty be withheld if guilt is not  ;based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. furthermore, the un guidelines on the role of prosecutors require prosecutors to perform their duties fairly, consistently and expeditiously...thus contributing to ensuring due process and the smooth functioning of the criminal justice system. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unreservedly in all cases. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for any relatives of john mcgrath and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of his death;

- calling for the authorities to take immediate steps to guarantee the safety of all those threatened, in accordance with their wishes; - welcoming the police protection ordered by the government for the chittagong press club;

55 prisoners have been put to death this year, 25 of them in texas. the pace of execution in texas is coming under increased scrutiny, especially since the illinois governor announced that he was suspending executions in his state because of its shameful record of wrongful convictions. a recent article in the chicago tribune, which had investigated the illinois death penalty prior to the january moratorium and found it to be riddled with injustice, concluded that the same problems, including inadequate defense representation and prosecutorial misconduct, were plaguing texas capital justice. in a 1990 report, the general accounting office (an independent agency of the us government) concluded that 82 per cent of the 28 major studies into racial discrimination and the us death penalty it had reviewed had found a correlation between the race of the victim and the likelihood of a death sentence; that is, that after taking all other factors into account, a defendant was several times more likely to be sentenced to death if the murder victim was white. of the 224 prisoners executed in texas since the state resumed judicial killing in 1982, 181 (81 per cent) were convicted of killing white people. in 1998, the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions concluded that race, ethnic origin and economic status appear to be key determinants of who will, and who will not, receive a death sentence in the united states. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - acknowledging the seriousness of the crime for which brian roberson is scheduled to be executed, and expressing sympathy for the relatives of james and lillian boots;

for the first time - that it was kilgore who had stabbed the victim. prior to the trial, the prosecution had told the defence that lucketts girlfriend would not be called on as a witness. she herself was facing a charge of hindering the prosecution by lying to the police about lucketts whereabouts.  however, at the sentencing phase, the prosecution called her to the stand to testify. just before she testified, she had agreed to a plea bargain in which she was granted probation in return for pleading guilty to the charge she was facing. prior to the trial, she had been extensively interviewed by the authorities, but had never before claimed that bruce kilgore was the actual killer. her testimony was the only evidence suggesting that kilgore, rather than luckett, wielded the knife. in 1997, a court of appeals for the 8th circuit noted that this was doubtless damaging testimony, and may very well have been a major factor in the jurys decision to sentence kilgore to death. at the potosi correctional center, bruce kilgore is one of 12 members of the voluntary youth enlightenment program. this group meet with juveniles who have been in trouble with the law, and relate their life stories with the aim of helping the juveniles to make better choices in their own lives. background information since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977, it has executed 548 prisoners, over 400 of whom have been put to death since 1990. as the pace of execution has accelerated, concern over the lottery of us death sentencing has deepened. race, economic status and the quality of defence representation appear to play a major part in who will, and who will not, receive a death sentence (bruce kilgore, who is black, was tried before an all-white jury). seventy-nine wrongly convicted prisoners have been exonerated in the usa since 1973 - including five in 1999 - after being sentenced to death. many came close to execution. others have been executed despite lingering doubts over their guilt. the usas use of capital punishment frequently fails to meet minimum international standards governing the death penalty. for example, mentally impaired prisoners have been sentenced to death and executed, and the usa continues to use the death penalty against juvenile offenders in violation of international law. one such prisoner - christopher thomas in virginia - is scheduled to be executed on the same day as bruce kilgore (ua 105/99 issued 12 may 1999). governor carnahan has the sole authority to grant clemency in missouri. in january 1999 he granted clemency to darrell mease at the request of pope john paul ii. meases execution had originally been scheduled to take place while the pope was in missouri. thirty-eight prisoners have been executed in the state since it resumed executions in 1989. recommended action: please telephone or send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: - expressing sympathy for the victims of violent crime and their families, and acknowledging the seriousness of the crime of which bruce kilgore was convicted and sentenced to death; - noting that bruce kilgores co-defendant received a life sentence, despite evidence that it was he who actually killed marilyn wilkins; -

a trial never has such luxury. norman newsted had robbed a bar in utah earlier in february 1984 with doug kaye and cynthia brosemer. three people were killed. brosemer gave herself up, was granted immunity from prosecution, and gave statements to the police. the oklahoma prosecution relied on newsteds involvement in this crime as the aggravating evidence to persuade the jury that he was a continuing threat to society and should be executed. the prosecution was allowed to present cynthia brosemer as a witness, despite defence protests that they had not been informed that this would happen and were therefore unprepared to cross-examine her. in her original statements to the police, withheld from the defence, brosemer said that newsted fired two non-fatal shots in the utah bar, but that it was kaye who killed all three victims. however, her testimony in court under the prosecutors questioning differed to the extent that it allowed the inference that newsted may have killed one or more of the utah victims.  because brosemers police statements had been concealed, the jury never heard her prior unequivocal testimony that it was kaye who had killed all three. the 10th circuit court agreed that the prosecutor should have disclosed these statements to the defence, as well as a police report noting signs of a struggle on buckleys body and clothing, given its relevance to newsteds self-defence argument. however the court stated that this prosecutorial misconduct was not necessarily prejudicial to newsteds defence. in utah, doug kaye negotiated a plea bargain that allowed him to escape the death penalty for the three killings in the bar in 1984.  the utah trial found that norman newsted had not killed any of the utah victims. background information since the usa resumed judicial executions in 1977, it has executed 548 people, over 400 of whom have been put to death since 1990.  race, economic status and the quality of defence representation appear to play a major part in who will, and who will not, receive a death sentence. prosecutorial misconduct, and the use of unreliable physical evidence or witness testimony have also contributed to this lottery, and even to wrongful convictions.  eighty us prisoners have been exonerated since 1973 - including six in 1999 - after being sentenced to death. many came close to execution. the use of the death penalty in the usa frequently fails to meet minimum international standards.  for example, mentally impaired prisoners have been sentenced to death and executed, and the usa continues to use the death penalty against child offenders in violation of international law. oklahoma has put 16 people to death since it resumed executions in 1990. since 1991 the states male death row inmates have been housed in h-unit of oklahoma state penitentiary, where amnesty international believes conditions amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, in violation of international standards.  inmates are moved to solitary confinement in special isolation punishment cells 30 days prior to their execution date in order to stop them killing themselves before the lethal injection team does. they are subjected to regular cell and body searches, and may even be x-rayed.  this policy was introduced after an inmate attempted to kill himself by overdosing shortly before his execution in 1995.  norman newsted was moved into an isolation cell on 8 june 1999. recommended action: please send e-mails/telegrams/faxes/express/airmail","","",2,TRUE

a mental evaluation revealing borderline mental retardation, acute paranoid and depressive disorders; expression of remorse; and indications that lingar was a good candidate for rehabilitation. lingar was clearly prejudiced by his counsels failure to develop and present this evidence. there is no reasonable probability that a jury advised of these circumstances would have imposed the death sentence on this mentally retarded and mentally disturbed young man. background information the us death penalty is a lethal lottery; who is sentenced to death can depend on a wide range of factors beyond the heinousness of the crime, including the quality of legal representation afforded to the defendant. one of the primary sources of arbitrariness is the prosecutors discretion in choosing in which cases and against which defendants to pursue a death sentence. time and time again in crimes involving two defendants, one is offered a plea bargain in return for testimony against the other. there have frequently been serious questions about whether the relative culpability of the defendants was reflected in the eventual outcome. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of thomas scott allen, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of his death; - expressing concern that stanley lingar is facing execution, and calling on the governor to commute his death sentence; - expressing concern that the state based its case on the testimony of a co-defendant who was granted leniency in return for testimony, and whose version of events was inconsistent with the medical evidence; - expressing concern that due to the inexperience of lingars trial attorney, the jurors who sentenced him to death never heard important mitigating evidence, including of his abusive background, his mental impairment, his remorse, and his potential for rehabilitation; - expressing concern about the prosecutors introduction of irrelevant and potentially inflammatory evidence of stanley lingars sexual orientation; - noting the widespread national concern about the fairness and reliability of the us death penalty. appeals to: the honorable bob holden governor of missouri missouri capitol building, room 216 p.o. box 720 jefferson city, mo 65102-0720","","",3,TRUE

"70/01","extra 70/01 death penalty / legal concern          16 october 2001 usa (georgia)          terry mincey, white, aged 40 terry mincey is scheduled to be executed in georgia on 25 october. he has spent more than 19 years - almost half his life - on death row. he was sentenced to death for the murder of paulette riggs in 1982. paulette riggs was shot dead on 12 april 1982 during a robbery of the store in macon where she worked. a second person, russell peterman, was also shot during the crime. he survived, blinded in one eye. terry mincey was sentenced to death in august 1982. two years earlier, terry mincey had had a near fatal motorcycle accident. at the trial, although family members testified that he had undergone a drastic personality change after the accident, with severe mood swings and an impaired memory, the defence presented no expert mental health evidence about the head injury and its possible effects. thus the jury never heard the type of expert opinion that was provided in a 1993 affidavit by a psychologist, who stated that the injury would have impaired minceys judgement and impulse control: minceys head injury was a significant factor in the case - a factor which when considered establishes that mr minceys actions on the night of the offense were the irrational impulsive actions of a brain damaged individual and not the actions of a cold, calculated, and premeditated murderer. eight years after the trial, terry minceys appeal lawyers discovered notes that the prosecutor had taken during a pretrial meeting with the states psychiatrist, who was a member of the state forensic team which had evaluated mincey in may 1982. the prosecutors notes included the following about terry mincey: brain damage in auto accident. reflexes more active on 1 side. this indicates motor muscle power differential. it is possible he might now be more susceptible to irrational behavior. the notes also indicated that mincey had a history of drug abuse, and had been under the influence of lsd or quaaludes at the time of the crime. in brady v maryland (1963), the us supreme court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused... violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. however, the appeal courts have dismissed minceys claim that the withheld evidence amounted to an unconstitutional brady violation, saying that the claim should have been raised earlier, and that even if the notes had been disclosed to the defence at the time of the trial, it would not have led to a different outcome. arguing for death at the 1982 trial, the prosecutor had argued that mincey would pose a future risk of violence, in prison or outside, if allowed to live. in almost two decades on death row, terry mincey has reportedly had one disciplinary write-up, for a minor non-violent breach of prison rules. he has continued to educate himself over the years, including, for example, by learning japanese. a journalist who covered the original trial for a local newspaper subsequently developed a friendship with terry mincey. he has recently written of mincey: his actions as well as his words demonstrate his remorse for his crime and for the destruction he has caused... he has spent nearly twenty years reflecting upon his life and his actions, and he appears to me to have matured and changed. terry is not the reckless, chaotic young man of april 1982.... background information since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 734 prisoners have been put to death, 51 of them this year. twenty-three people have been executed in georgia, most recently on 9 june 1998. the us death penalty is supposedly reserved for the worst of the worst, but who lives and who dies is influenced by many factors outside of the heinousness of the crime, including the quality of legal representation, and the discretion and conduct of prosecutors. the past two years or so has seen a growing national concern about the fairness and reliability of the capital justice system, as evidence of its arbitrary, discriminatory and error-prone nature has continued to mount. in recent months, executions in georgia have been on hold as the state supreme court has deliberated on the constitutionality of the electric chair as an execution method. on 5 october, the court ruled 4-3 that execution by electrocution violates the states constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. the ruling means that the method of execution in georgia is now lethal injection. the states use of lethal injection is now being challenged. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of questions of guilt or innocence, and irrespective of the method of execution selected to end the prisoners life. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity; every execution a symptom of, not a solution to, a culture of violence. the death penalty denies the possibility of human change, and offers no constructive contribution to societys efforts to confront violent crime or to assist its victims. today some 109 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of paulette riggs, and acknowledging the seriousness of the crime and the suffering it has caused; - expressing concern that the jury never heard any expert evidence of the extent and effects of terry minceys head injury, and expressing concern that the prosecutor withheld psychiatric evidence that the brain damage made mincey susceptible to irrational conduct; - noting terry minceys exemplary record during nearly 20 years on death row, in contrast to the prosecutors predictions; - noting increasing national concern about the fairness and reliability of the us capital justice system, and that the usa is far out of step with international aspirations and global trends on this issue;

that her parents fought with themselves, friends and other family, and that there was never any love shown in our home. she indicated that her father was a drug addict, who stole to feed his addiction, and did god awful things in front of us. she has stated that emerson and the other siblings were beaten with extension cords and water hoses. emerson rudds cousin has also signed an affidavit testifying to the physical and mental abuse that emerson was subjected to from an early age. the death of emerson rudds elder brother in front of him is said to have been particularly traumatic. the appeal courts have rejected claims that emerson rudds trial lawyer was ineffective for not having presented to the jury the full details of his young clients abusive upbringing. the courts have responded that some of this information was presented, and that any more would simply have been cumulative and would not necessarily have changed the jurys sentencing decision. the courts have also rejected the appeal lawyers efforts to review the states file on the case to determine if there is any exculpatory evidence in it. emerson rudds lawyer is asking governor rick perry to grant a 30-day reprieve, pending resolution of the issue of payments to lawyers for their work preparing clemency petitions to the texas board of pardons and paroles. earlier in october, he filed a motion in a federal district court seeking either pre-payment of funds to prepare a clemency petition for emerson rudd or a stay of execution, pending a decision by another federal court in a separate case where this issue has been raised. the lawyer has stated that he has been financially unable to file a clemency petition on behalf of emerson rudd. the deadline for filing such a petition with the board has now passed. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. it is a punishment that is a symptom of, not a solution to, a culture of violence. more than 100 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. in contrast, the usa continues its relentless resort to an outdated punishment which is an affront to human dignity and denies the human capacity for rehabilitation and reconciliation. the us capital justice system is characterized by arbitrariness, discrimination and error, as well as the inevitable cruelty. who is sentenced to death is as much influenced by the quality of defence representation, the discretionary power of prosecutors, and the race and economic status of the murder victim or defendant, as it is on the heinousness of the original crime. there have been 56 executions in the usa this year, bringing to 739 the number of prisoners put to death in the country since 1977. texas accounts for 253 of these executions, 14 of which have taken place this year. the last person executed in texas was gerald mitchell, who was 17 years old at the time of the crime. his execution violated the international legal ban on the use of the death penalty for crimes committed by under 18-year-olds. emerson rudd was less than a month past 18 at the time of the crime. while this places his case outside the international legal prohibition, the principle that lies behind that ban - namely the recognition of a young persons immaturity and capacity for change - demands consideration and compassion from the clemency authorities. in texas, the governor can commute a death sentence if the board of pardons and paroles recommends that he or she does so. the governor also has the power to grant a 30-day reprieve. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of steve morgan; - noting that emerson rudd had just turned 18 at the time of the crime and was emerging from a childhood of abuse and neglect; - expressing concern that the jury did not hear the full details of his background in order to be able to make a fully considered decision; - noting that the power of executive clemency exists to compensate for the rigidity of the courts, and allows for a compassionate state response; - expressing concern that emerson rudds lawyer has been unable, due to financial constraints, to file a clemency petition with the board of pardons and paroles; - calling on the governor to grant a 30-day reprieve to allow more time for resolution of this issue in the courts and to allow a fair opportunity for a clemency petition to be presented should the courts rule favourably;

abolished in law or practice by a majority of countries - that is a symptom of violence rather than a solution to it. in contrast to the global abolitionist trend, the usa has executed more than 600 people since 1990, including 58 this year, two of them in georgia in the past two weeks. supposedly reserved for the worst of the worst crimes and offenders, the us death penalty could more accurately be said to be reserved for the poor, the emotionally scarred, the mentally impaired, and the inadequately represented, with racial discrimination and prosecutorial discretion also influencing which of the thousands of murders committed each year will result in an execution. between 1976 and 1996, for example, nearly 52,000 men and women were murdered by people with whom they shared an intimate relationship, such as spouses or ex-spouses. few resulted in the state pursuing the death penalty. it seems that, in fred gilreaths case, the trial judge and the prosecutor both believed that this apparently unplanned alcohol-fuelled crime did not deserve the death penalty either. us politicians have frequently expressed their support for the death penalty in terms of victims rights, suggesting that a state-sanctioned retributive killing can somehow achieve emotional closure to the pain suffered by the relatives of murder victims. the same politicians will routinely overlook that the state is itself engaged in creating more grief and suffering, that of the loved ones of the condemned (see usa: state cruelty to families, amr 51/132/2001, 4 september 2001). recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for all those affected by the deaths of linda gilreath and gerrit van leeuwen in 1979; - noting that the prosecutor originally offered fred gilreath a life sentence, and that the trial judge also apparently believed that the death penalty was an inappropriate punishment for this crime; -

rather than give a straight answer, the judge replied: you should impose such punishment as you feel is just under the evidence... you are not to concern yourselves with what may happen afterwards. under virginias then three strikes laws, a person convicted of three separate crimes of murder, rape, or armed robbery becomes ineligible for parole. the jurors, unaware that ramdasss third strike meant that he would never get out of prison if they sentenced him to life, voted for death. the defence lawyer reported that three jurors later told him that they would have voted for life if they had known that ramdass would not be released from prison. in 1994 the us supreme court ruled in simmons v. south carolina that where a defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and state law prohibits his release on parole, due process requires that the sentencing jury be informed that the defendant is parole ineligible.  however, the virginia supreme court, which has reversed fewer death sentences than any other state supreme court in the usa, ruled on ramdasss appeal that simmons did not apply to bobby ramdass because of a legal technicality. the court reasoned that because the judge in the second of the three cases - the dominos pizza robbery - had not yet formally signed the jurys verdict in that case when the 7-eleven jury asked its question on 30 january 1993, technically bobby ramdass was not at that moment ineligible for parole.  that, the state argued, only occurred 19 days later on 18 february when the dominos pizza judge signed the jury verdict. in 1998 a federal judge, citing simmons, ordered a new sentencing hearing. however, the notoriously conservative 4th circuit court of appeals reversed his decision, deferring to the virginia supreme courts hyper-technical ruling. one of the three 4th circuit judges dissented: splitting hairs when a mans life is at stake is not becoming to a judiciary or a legal system. i do not believe that due process requires or allows such arbitrary results... ramdass had a constitutional due process right to inform the jury of the wholly accurate information that by the time the sentence they were deliberating was officially entered by the judge [on 6 april 1993], he would be ineligible under state law for parole. on 23 november 1999 the us supreme court stopped ramdasss execution three hours before it was due in order to examine his simmons claim. on 12 june 2000 it upheld the death sentence. four of the nine justices dissented. they described as an acute unfairness the fact that the state had been allowed to use the dominos pizza conviction to argue ramdasss future dangerousness, while simultaneously denying the defence the opportunity to argue that conviction made him ineligible for parole.  the dissenting opinion said: even the most miserly reading [of simmons] supports the conclusion that [ramdass] was denied one of the hallmarks of due process in our adversary system, namely, the defendants right to meet the states case against him. the dissent continued: we know this jury thought the information was critical; we know this jury would have recommended life instead of death if it had known that ramdass was parole ineligible. bobby ramdasss childhood in washington dc was marked by poverty, abuse and neglect.  a psychiatrist has referred to his unbelievably dysfunctional family which has presented the worst possible role models for him. he was physically abused by his mothers husband, who denied that bobby was his child. bobby witnessed his mother shoot her husband (he survived) in an act of self-defence when he attempted to kill bobbys infant brother.  after she and her husband separated, she and her children allegedly lived for a while in a storage bin and stole food to survive. ramdasss criminal record began at the age of 14. the kayani murder occurred when he was 20, shortly after his release from a four-year prison term. in a november 1999 letter to governor gilmore, bobby ramdass wrote: youve already heard about all the bad things ive done in the past, and i did rob and murder... but now im not the same person i was then. i finally grew up... if i could, i would take all the pain away and change everything ive done. but i cant.  all i can tell you is i know the value of life now. he wrote that he wants to help young prisoners avoid his","","",2,TRUE

43 member countries with 800 million inhabitants - adopted a resolution calling into question the usas observer status with the council because of the usas continuing resort to the death penalty. in april, the usa was voted off the un commission on human rights. a former us assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labor, described the vote as a wake-up call that the era of automatic global deference to us leadership on human rights is over. our belief in our global exceptionalism has too often led us to vote alone at the commission, falsely assuming that such isolationism has no costs. among the issues he cited was the usas continuing refusal to support resolutions calling for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible. please write in your own words, using the following points if you wish: - expressing sympathy for the victims of violent crime, and their families; - expressing the view that the death penalty contributes nothing constructive to societys efforts to combat violence, and simply creates more grief and suffering - that of the families of the condemned; - expressing deep concern that oklahoma continues to be a leading death penalty state in the usa, pointing out the immense damage that is being done to the usas reputation abroad in an increasingly abolitionist world; -

by being branded' with a red-hot iron and by an electric drill applied to their limbs, shredding their muscles. according to a bbc report, iranian state television said that said qanbar zahi was tried on 11 march 2006. amnesty international has no other information concerning the legal proceedings faced by the seven, but there are concerns that they may have faced summary trials, and may not have had access to defense lawyers. amnesty international recognizes the rights and responsibilities of governments to bring to justice those suspected of criminal offences, but opposes the death penalty in all cases as the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. moreover, iran is a state party to international treaties which prohibit the execution of those under the age of 18 at the time of their alleged offence. background information iran's baluchi minority lives mainly in the southeast of the country, and is believed to constitute between one and three percent of the total population of around 70 million. mainly sunni muslims, they have for many years complained of discrimination by the iranian authorities. jondallah, or the iranian peoples resistance movement, has carried out a number of armed attacks on iranian officials and has on occasion killed hostages. it reportedly seeks to defend the rights of the baluchi people, though government officials have claimed that it is involved in drug smuggling and has ties to terrorist groups and to foreign governments. amnesty international condemns unequivocally the killing of hostages and urges jondallah to desist from this or similar practices immediately. according to a bbc report on 15 march, sistan-baluchistan television has stated that at least two people have been hanged in connection with the attack on the bus carrying revolutionary guards. five days after it took place, an iranian baluchi man, nasrollah shanbeh-zehi, was executed in connection with the attack. he was shown on iranian television confessing to the bombing on behalf of jondallah and was executed in public at the site of the bombing. it is thought that the other man allegedly executed in connection with the attack may have been ahmad sariz, allegedly a member of jondallah, who was reportedly hanged on 14 march. reports indicate that at least 17 other individuals have either been sentenced to death or executed in connection with an attack in tasuki in march 2006, in which up to 22 people were reportedly killed. in an interview with the iranian newspaper ayyaran on 17 march, hossein ali shahryari, a parliamentarian representing the city of zahedan, stated that prisons in sistan-baluchistan province hold more than 700 people under sentence of death. in 2006, at least 177 people were executed in iran, including at least four women and four people who were under 18 at the time of the alleged offence. possibly as many as one-third of these were members of irans baluchi minority. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - stating that amnesty international recognizes the right and responsibility of governments to bring to justice those suspected of criminal offences, but opposes the death penalty as the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment;

- noting that the case against charlie mason alston was circumstantial, that he has always maintained his innocence, and that doubts have been raised about the reliability of the states case against him; - expressing concern that the state has lost physical evidence from the crime which had the potential to identify the perpetrator; - noting the existence of unidentified fingerprints at the crime scene; - expressing concern that the trial lawyers were inexperienced in the complexities of capital cases, and that the case has not had full federal review because his appeal was filed too late; - noting the large number of errors discovered in capital cases;

in 1993 for the murder of three police officers and the wife of another officer in december 1991. moniteau county deputy sheriff les roark was shot at jim johnsons home after he arrived to investigate a domestic disturbance. johnson then drove to the home of the sheriff where a christmas party was in progress. he opened fire, killing the sheriffs wife, pam jones. he drove to the home of deputy sheriff russell borts and shot him through the window. deputy borts survived. johnson then went to the sheriffs office, where there were officers from a number of jurisdictions. cooper county sheriff charles smith was shot dead as he came out of the building. miller county deputy sandra wilson was shot and killed a few moments later. at his trial, jim johnson pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. the defense position was that he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) as a result of his wartime experiences in vietnam, and that he had experienced vietnam-related flashbacks on the night of the murders which made him believe that he was confronted by the enemy and rendered him incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct. in his opening statement, the defense lawyer drew attention to a perimeter of rope and tin cans set up around johnsons property, a foil wrapper in the garage, and the flattened tires on his car. he theorized that johnson, as in wartime, had set up the tin-can-rope perimeter to warn him of anyone approaching, that he ate a baked potato which had been cooked in foil while preparing to go out on a military mission, and that he had disabled his vehicle by slashing the tires in order that the enemy could not use it. this defense quickly unraveled, and the lawyers lack of preparation was revealed, when the state called witnesses who said that police officers, while waiting for johnson to return from the shootings, had set up the rope perimeter, left the foil, and flattened the tires of the car to prevent johnson from using it. the prosecution capitalized on the defense lawyers error by asserting that it was just one illustration of the defendants lies behind his ptsd defense. three experts testified for the defense that johnson suffered from ptsd, but the jury convicted him on four counts of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death on all four counts. in 1998, the missouri supreme court upheld the conviction and death sentence, rejecting the claim that inadequate legal representation had undermined the fairness of the trial and the reliability of its outcome. one of the five judges dissented saying that johnson should receive a new trial. judge ronnie white wrote: defense counsels unprofessional failure to interview [the prosecution witnesses] led the defense to make demonstrably false claims in its opening statement, claims that utterly destroyed the credibility of the ptsd theory before the defense even presented any evidence... i find it reasonably likely that a jury that had not seen the defense destroy its own credibility on this issue would have been sufficiently receptive to the expert diagnosis of a mental disease or defect to permit a reasonable likelihood of a different result... while mr johnson may not, as the jury found, have met the legal definition of insanity, whatever drove mr johnson to go from being a law-abiding citizen to being a multiple killer was certainly something akin to madness. i am not convinced that the performance of his counsel did not rob mr johnson of any opportunity he might have had to convince the jury that he was not responsible for his actions. jim johnson is reported to be a model inmate who is respected by staff and inmates and serves as a christian spiritual leader in the prison. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty unreservedly, and believes that it can make no constructive contribution to efforts to combat violent crime. more than 100 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 749 people have been put to death, 53 of them in missouri. there have been 66 executions in 2001. international standards require that capital defendants have adequate legal assistance at all stages of proceedings. the un commission on human rights has adopted resolutions urging retentionist countries not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person. in 1999, judge ronnie white, the dissenting judge in johnsons unsuccessful appeal, was nominated by president clinton to be a federal judge. the us senate voted to reject the nomination. a republican party campaign against the nomination was led by missouri senator john ashcroft. he depicted white, the first african-american judge to sit on the missouri supreme court, as pro-criminal in part because of his perceived reluctance to support death sentences. yet judge white had affirmed the death sentence in 41 out of 59 capital cases that had come before him, and in 10 out the 18 cases in which he voted against the death sentence, he was in the company of a unanimous court. judge white remains on the missouri supreme court. john ashcroft has since become us attorney general. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of the four murder victims in this case, and stressing that you do not seek to excuse the violent manner of their deaths; - expressing concern that the errors of jim johnsons lawyer dealt a severe blow to his defense of mental illness, raising doubts as to the reliability of the outcome of the case; - noting the dissenting opinion of judge ronnie white that jim johnson has been denied adequate legal representation, citing international standards; - noting that jim johnson has been a model prisoner, respected by staff and inmates; - calling on the governor to commute this death sentence and to support a moratorium in his state. appeals to: the honorable bob holden governor of missouri missouri capitol building, room 216 po box 720 jefferson city, mo

or her feet, stomp on him and stuff, didnt matter to her... he would look at her wrong or something and she would just threaten to scratch his little eyeballs out... she would put her nails on his face and stuff, and we would stop her.  when john was four, his mother dipped him in scalding water in the kitchen sink, causing permanent scarring. another time she tried to drown him in the bath. she would often lock him in a room alone for long periods, where he would be forced to soil himself. at times she would make him eat his own feces and drink his urine. one time, she took a knife and threatened to cut off his penis for wetting his bed. neighbors would later tell of the toddlers daily terrible, terrible screams. by the age of 10, it was apparent that john penry was mentally retarded. he had been unable to learn in school and never finished the first grade (age 6-7). various institutions made various diagnoses of his impairment, including organic brain syndrome with mental retardation and behavioural disturbances and organic brain syndrome with psychosis due to repeated trauma and mild retardation. his intelligence quotient (iq) scores ranged between 50 and 63. to this day, he can barely read or write. taken out of a school for the mentally retarded at the age of 16, he then lived with relatives in livingston, texas. at 17, he was briefly committed to a psychiatric hospital after an act of arson. at 21, he was given a five-year prison sentence for rape, but was released on parole in august 1979 after serving two years. a psychological report indicated that his mental impairment might lead to aggressive acts. on 25 october 1979, 23-year-old john penry went to the home of pamela moseley carpenter, a member of one of livingstons best known families (her brother was a professional football star). john penry beat and allegedly raped the 22-year-old woman, before stabbing her with the scissors she had tried to fend him off with. she died in hospital. the american association on mental retardation (aamr) states: the death penalty is disproportionate to the level of culpability possible for people with mental retardation. executing people with mental retardation does not serve justice. a brief filed for john penry in the fifth circuit, by the aamr and others working in the field of mental retardation, also suggests that society must accept some responsibility for its failures to respond adequately to those whose mental impairments make them a risk to others. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters in your own words using the following as a guide: - acknowledging the seriousness of the 1979 crime, and expressing sympathy for the family and friends of pamela moseley carpenter; - noting that in 13 of the usas 38 death penalty states, the execution of john paul penry would be prohibited (arkansas, colorado, georgia, indiana, kansas, kentucky, maryland, nebraska, new mexico, new york, south dakota, tennessee and washington have legislated against executing the retarded); - urging that john penry be spared as a first step towards texas joining this growing national consensus, and in line with long-held international standards of justice and decency; - urging the board of pardons and paroles to recommend clemency; - urging governor bush to do all in his power to stop this execution, including a written request that the board of pardons and paroles investigate and consider commutation, as provided for under title 37, rule 143.58 of the texas administrative code ([the bpp] shall investigate and consider a recommendation of commutation of sentence in any case, upon the written request of the governor). appeals to: board of pardons and paroles p.o. box 13401 austin, tx 78711-3401","","",2,TRUE

prosecution intends to seek a death sentence. curtis woodyard was 17 at the time of the crime with which he has been charged. international law, respected in almost every country in the world apart from the usa, prohibits the use of the death penalty against people who were under 18 years old at the time of the crime. curtis woodyard is accused of the capital murder of gordon edward petty, a white male, committed on 27 november 2000 in augusta. jury selection for his trial is scheduled to begin on 12 november 2002. background information there is an unequivocal international prohibition on the use of the death penalty against child offenders, people who were under 18 at the time of the crime. the geneva conventions, the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr), the convention on the rights of the child (crc), the american convention on human rights and the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, all have provisions exempting this age group from the death penalty. under the 1989 us supreme court decision, stanford v kentucky , defendants who were 16 or 17 years old at the time of the crime can be subject to the death penalty in the usa. since that decision, 191 countries have ratified the crc. the usa has not ratified the crc, but has signed it, thereby binding itself under international law not to do anything to undermine the treatys provisions pending a decision on whether to ratify it. the usa ratified the iccpr in 1992, but lodged a reservation purporting to exempt it from the prohibition on the use of death penalty against child offenders. the human rights committee, the expert body established by the iccpr to oversee the treatys implementation, has said that the reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the covenant and should be withdrawn. the committee has deplored the usas continuing execution of child offenders, and confirmed that the iccprs prohibition on such executions is a principle from which there can be no derogation. in 2000, the un sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights affirmed that such use of the death penalty violates customary international law, binding on all countries regardless of which treaties they have or have not ratified. since 1990, the usa has executed 18 child offenders, compared to 14 such executions reported in the rest of the world combined. these 14 occurred in democratic republic of congo (drc), iran, nigeria, pakistan, saudi arabia, and yemen. yemen and pakistan have now abolished such use of the death penalty in law. in 2001, the drc authorities commuted the death sentences of five child offenders, and there is currently a moratorium on executions there. as the other perpetrators drop out of this infamous club, the usas record as its leading member stands in ever starker relief. the usa accounts for 70 per cent of the known executions of child offenders worldwide since 1998 (12 out of 17). in september 2002, amnesty international published usa: indecent and internationally illegal: the death penalty against child offenders (amr 51/143/2002, available on www.amnesty.org. in it, the organization argued that the us supreme court should reconsider its 1989 stanford v kentucky decision in light of its june 2002 ruling, atkins v virginia . in the latter decision, it found the death penalty against people with mental retardation unconstitutional in the light of evolving standards of decency. among other things, the court acknowledged the relevance of international standards. however, on 21 october 2002, the court refused to take the appeal of kevin stanford, whose case was at the centre of the 1989 stanford v kentucky decision and who remains on death row. four of the nine supreme court justices dissented from the denial of the appeal: there are no valid procedural objections to our reconsideration of the issue now, and, given our recent decision in atkins v virginia , we certainly should do so. the dissent continued that the execution of people for crimes committed when they were under 18 years old is a relic of the past and is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency in a civilized society. we should put an end to this shameful practice. several newspapers, including the new york times and the washington post , have since editorialized that the supreme court should revisit the juvenile death penalty issue and outlaw the practice. the cases of at least two of the more than 80 child offenders on death row in the usa are currently pending before the court. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of gordon edward petty, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of his death or comment on the guilt or innocence of the accused; - expressing concern that, in the event of his conviction, richmond county is intending to seek a death sentence against curtis woodyard, in violation of international law which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime; - noting that this international prohibition is respected in almost every country of the world outside the usa; - pointing out the damage that is being done to usas reputation as a result of local prosecutors seeking internationally illegal death sentences; - noting the recent dissent of four supreme court justices supporting an end to this shameful practice; - calling on the district

a police officer and a former inmate, who said that james brown had made statements suggesting that he was faking his mental illness. the credibility of these witnesses has since been called into serious question. appeal courts have held that the trial lawyers were ineffective in not having impeached this testimony, but under the stringent us supreme court precedent on this issue, have ruled that the prisoner had not proved that this failure had affected the outcome of the proceedings. like many on death row in the usa, james willie brown comes from a background of poverty, deprivation and serious abuse. according to a 1994 affidavit given by a clinical psychologist, james brown was born in 1948 to a 15-year-old mother and an alcoholic father. theirs was one of the poorest families in a low-income neighborhood. the children were subjected to routine physical abuse, principally by the father. according to the","","",2,TRUE

[basden] initially thought the idea was crazy and refused. meanwhile, lynwood taylor suggested ideas for sylvia white, including that she make the murder look like suicide. she rejected that idea because she had already had one husband who had been found to have committed suicide and another would look too suspicious (that husband had reportedly suffered arsenic poisoning for a year before being found dead with a gunshot wound to the head). ernest basden became involved in the plot after he became unable to work due to illness and ran into financial difficulties. according to his appeal lawyers, his vulnerable state meant that he was easily pressured into becoming involved by his nephew. as basdens drug supplier, lynwood taylor also knew that basden had a drug and alcohol problem. he allegedly lied to his uncle that billy white was violent towards sylvia white. it was ernest basden who actually shot billy white, with a gun reportedly provided by lynwood taylor. taylor also planned specific details of the crime. not long after the murder, ernest basden voluntarily went to the police, and gave a detailed confession, saying that he had shot billy white because he needed the money. he also said that his nephew had plied him with marijuana, alcohol, cocaine and valium on the day of the murder. ernest basden was the first of the three defendants to be tried. he was appointed a lawyer who was dying from leukemia. despite his illness, which required repeated spells in hospital, the lawyer refused to step down. for almost a year, no significant pre-trial motions were filed in the case. six weeks before the trial, the lawyer withdrew from the case (he died a few months later). the court refused to postpone the trial to allow his replacement more time to prepare. in 2002, the fourth circuit court of appeals acknowledged that at least one of the several claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on appeal was particularly troubling. the court also found  troubling the prosecutions withholding of certain evidence from the defence until the first morning of the trial. the jury sentenced ernest basden to death, after a long deliberation, despite finding several mitigating factors. these included the fact that he was under the influence of a mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the crime, was remorseful, had accepted responsibility, was cooperative with the police, and that his character and prior conduct was inconsistent with the crime. the fourth circuit court of appeals noted that the jurys finding that basden was under the domination of taylor and affected by alcohol and drugs at the time of the killing meant that at least one of the jurors... accepted, in sum, that he was an intoxicated, manipulated, rube [bumpkin]. one of the original trial jurors recently expressed the sincere hope that the governor will stop the killing of mr basden as he does not deserve to be killed. another juror recently recalled that throughout the majority of the deliberations, nine of the 12 jurors wanted to give ernest life instead of death. the juror explained that two of the other jurors convinced the rest that ernest basden would be released within a few years if they voted for life. the juror stated that the two jurors also convinced the remainder of the jurors that, if they sentenced basden to death, he would never actually be executed but would simply serve a longer prison sentence than if he was given life. in 1993, sylvia white was convicted of the first-degree murder of her four-year-old stepson. the state did not seek the death penalty. in 1996, she was offered a plea bargain to second-degree murder for her involvement in the murder of billy white. lynwood taylor was offered a plea bargain and had his sentencing postponed for three years. sylvia white and lynwood taylor received prison terms for their role in the billy white murder and will be eligible for parole in 2005 and 2013 respectively. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, every execution a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. moreover, the us death penalty, supposedly reserved for the worst of the worst, is characterized by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. today, 111 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. fifty-eight people have been put to death in the usa this year, bringing to 807 the number of executions since 1977. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of billy white s death, or to minimize the suffering it will have caused; - noting the range of mitigating factors in the case, including ernest basdens long-held remorse and his domination by his co-defendant, lynwood taylor; - noting evidence that the jury had not wanted to sentence ernest basden to death, and noting the states more lenient approach to his co-conspirators, who will be eligible for parole within the next few years; - noting that the fourth circuit court of appeals has described the case as troubling, and expressing concern that ernest basden was represented until shortly before his trial by a lawyer whose terminal illness can only have impaired his preparation, and that the trial court refused to delay the trial to allow the replacement counsel more time to prepare;

(see memorandum to president clinton - an appeal for human rights leadership as first federal execution looms (amr 51/158/00), available with an open letter to president clinton (amr 51/164/00) on www.amnesty.org). the first federal execution for 37 years is looming at a time of unprecedented national and international concern about the us death penalty. amnesty international believes that president clinton must grasp the opportunity to send a strong message to his country that it is time for it to rethink its attachment to the death penalty. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - expressing sympathy for the victims of violent crime and their families, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone such crimes or belittle the suffering they cause; - calling on president clinton to commute juan raul garzas death sentence, noting that the justice departments findings of widespread racial and geographic disparities in the application of the federal death penalty are of direct relevance to his case; - expressing concern that the federal government is planning to resume executions after nearly four decades; - arguing that, even for those who support the death penalty, it is surely inappropriate for federal executions to resume in the knowledge that the system may be tainted by arbitrariness and discrimination; - noting the unprecedented national and international concern about the fairness and reliability of the us death penalty; - urging president clinton to live up to his often stated commitment to international human rights standards and his recent claim that the usa had become a more decent, more humane country under his presidency; - calling on the president to declare a moratorium on federal executions, in light of the justice departments findings, and as a step toward leading his country away from its lethally flawed attachment to the death penalty. appeals to: president bill clinton the white house office of the president 1600 pennsylvania avenue washington, dc 20500","","",2,TRUE

the offices of a number of organizations have been broken into and important data stolen, altered or destroyed. the guatemalan authorities have been ineffective in investigating or preventing such harassment. amnesty international has recently launched a section level campaign on guatemala in response to the deteriorating human rights situation and the guatemalan governments failure to implement the 1996 peace accords and the recommendations of the un-sponsored historical clarification commission. on february 28, amnesty international issued an investigative report, guatemalas lethal legacy: past impunity and renewed human rights violations. this report asserts that the guatemalan governments failure to act against perpetrators of past atrocitiescommitted during the 36-year civil conflictencourages past perpetrators and others to abuse authority and commit crimes with impunity. ai is aware of at least one additional case during the past year in which individuals associated with an important guatemalan human rights case reported threats in the united states (see nsa #4/01). amnesty international is concerned that these acts may form part of an international campaign of intimidation aimed at undermining the work of guatemalan human rights defenders and others involved in or reporting on human rights inquiries or corruption issues. recommended action: please send emails/faxes/express/airmail letters: - explaining ai's concerns about the continuing series of threats against ms. bocek in the united states; - noting that while united states law enforcement agencies are investigating the matter, there is concern that the threats may be orchestrated from guatemala by individuals who are thus beyond the normal reach of u.s. agencies; - calling upon guatemalan authorities to undertake an immediate and thorough investigation into the threats against ms. bocek, including the june 11 abduction in guatemala and its apparent connection to the death threats and assault in the united states, and to determine whether official state agents, or people working closely with them, are in fact responsible for the assaults and harassment; - insisting that those responsible for these acts be brought to justice; - expressing concern for the safety of all those working to protect human rights and freedom of expression in guatemala, particularly those related to the bishop gerardi murder case and others who have suffered recent threats or intimidation. appeals to: (if your emails are returned please send your appeals as faxes or through the mail.) president of the republic of guatemala: lic. alfonso portillo cabrera presidente de la republica de guatemala 6a. avenida 'a' 4-41, zona 1 ciudad de guatemala guatemala","","",2,TRUE

although she is receiving medical treatment, she continues to suffer from the aftermath of torture. one case reported from jaffna in the north in april 1998 concerns a 24-year-old student who was taken into custody by the army at uduvil. soldiers apparently arrested her in the belief that she was her sister who was a member of the ltte.  during the first few days in detention, she was kept handcuffed but not interrogated or tortured. after seven days in custody, a group of women soldiers came into the cell and hung her upside down from a crossbar.  they told her that the punishment was going to get worse day by day if she did not tell the truth.  the next day, two soldiers burned her right arm with cigarettes.  on the next day, they came and sexually assaulted her by pinching her breasts, thighs and putting their hands inside her underwear.  two days later, a soldier came in and told her and another woman detainee that he would help them to escape.  he took them late at night through the back of the camp to a remote place where another soldier was waiting. each year, a number of rape cases by members of the security forces are reported, particularly in the north and east.  it is highly likely that other cases go unreported. in a sworn statement obtained by amnesty international, the student described what happened subsequently as follows:  ""the one who had brought us there came up to me and the other soldier went up to the other girl...then we realized that we might be in danger from them.  we started screaming.  the one with me stuffed a handkerchief into my mouth and began fondling and cuddling me.  he touched and squeezed my breasts.  he sucked my cheek...we were behind a bush.  i tried to push him away but he pulled and tore my blouse.  then he pulled my bra off.  he removed his trousers. he took off my nickers.  then he was naked and he did everything he had to do to me.  it was too painful to me.  he raped me.  the whole ordeal lasted about 1/2 hour."" amnesty has received further reports of rape by the army in vavuniya in january 1997 and in jaffna in 1996 and 1997.  in batticaloa in the east, both police and army have been held  responsible for rape. in several of these cases of rape, investigations are proceeding slowly. other cases have collapsed because the victims or the witnesses feared reprisals.  one case reported from jaffna in july 1997 collapsed when the victim withdrew her statement to the police after receiving a large sum of money from the soldiers allegedly responsible for raping her. the ltte has itself been responsible for the torture and killing of persons detained by the group.  amnesty international has also received reports of ill-treatment of children as young as 14 who were apparently forcibly recruited by the ltte. the sri lankan government has during the last few years taken a number of steps, which, if fully implemented, could go a long way toward eradicating torture in sri lanka.  nevertheless, while a handful of cases are reportedly pending in the courts, so far no one has been convicted of torture in sri lanka. please write to the sri lankan government and urge that: _   the government should review and revise the emergency regulations and the prevention of terrorism act, taking into account comments made by the un human rights committee, the u.n committee against torture and the sri lankan supreme court.  in particular, provisions in the ers and the pta that allow confessions extracted under torture to be used as evidence in court should be repealed. _   anyone involved in acts of torture should be promptly brought to justice. _   the government should provide training and chain of command control to ensure that officers understand that torture of detainees is prohibited. _   all victims of torture should obtain compensation and rehabilitation from the government. please write to: her excellency president chandrika bandaranaike kumaratunga, presidential secretariat temple trees, colombo 3, sri lanka","","",4,TRUE

http://www.amnesty-usa.org/urgact/ extra 91/99              death penalty / legal concern  20 july 1999 usa (alabama)   victor kennedy, aged 37, black victor kennedy is scheduled to die in alabamas electric chair on 6 august 1999. he was sentenced to death in 1982 for the murder, during a burglary, of an 86-year-old white woman, annie laura orr, at her home in the early hours of 24 december 1980. at the time of the crime, kennedy and his co-defendant, darrell grayson, also black, had been drinking heavily. they decided to burgle annie orr, who had occasionally hired grayson to mow her lawn and carry out repairs in her home in the small town of montevallo. ms orr was raped during the crime, and later died from suffocation as a result of having a pillowcase taped tightly around her head during the assault. victor kennedy turned himself in on 24 december after he heard that the police were looking for him. he gave three statements to the police. in the first he said that he had waited outside the house for grayson to come out. his second and third statements said that he had gone into the house, but had not taken part in the assault on ms orr. unlike with grayson, there was no forensic evidence positively identifying kennedy as having raped ms orr. kennedy was 18 years old, of limited intelligence and education (see below), and suffering the after-effects of alcohol at the time of his interrogation. despite this he was allowed to waive his rights to remain silent, to have a lawyer appointed as he was indigent, and to have that lawyer present during interrogation. the police officer who questioned him made little attempt to ensure that kennedy genuinely understood these rights (known as miranda rights). the officer testified at the trial that kennedy had responded yes to his questions about whether he understood his rights, but that he had indicated no further understanding of them. the officer reportedly testified that kennedy had pretended to read [his miranda rights] and did sign the waiver. the police neglected to tell kennedy that he could be facing the death penalty.  the three statements formed the main evidence against him at his subsequent trial. the rest of the evidence against him was circumstantial. the federal courts have rejected kennedys claims that his miranda rights were violated, ruling that he had missed his opportunity to raise this claim earlier in the appeals process. however, a district court granted kennedy a new trial and sentencing on two other grounds. firstly, it ruled that he had received ineffective defence representation at the sentencing phase of the trial, because his lawyer had failed to investigate or present evidence of his low intelligence, traumatic childhood or possible lesser role in the crime, evidence which could have mitigated against a death sentence. the court also found that the prosecution had acted improperly, by failing to provide the defence with graysons statements, which included evidence that kennedy may have had a lesser role in the killing. however, the state appealed and in 1995 the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit overturned the district courts ruling. the higher court decided that kennedy would not have benefited from graysons statements even if they had been made available, and that his claim of ineffective representation was barred on technical grounds, because he had not raised it earlier in the appeals process. between the ages of six and 11, victor kennedy lived in missouri with his mother and her husband. the latter, who was not victors natural father, drank heavily and used heroin intravenously in the young boys presence, as well as subjecting ms kennedy to severe beatings. on one occasion he stabbed her, and she had to wait until he was asleep before she could leave the house to seek medical attention. the beatings continued until victor was about 14, as the husband would continue to come to the kennedy home even after ms kennedy had left him. at 16, victor kennedy dropped out of school, where he had reportedly been put into special education classes because of his low ability, including in reading, writing, maths and science. at school his iq was measured as from the mid-70s to mid-80s (a person of average intelligence would score 100). this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. darrell grayson, who was tried after victor kennedy, is now on death row. he does not have an execution date at present. background information more than 400 prisoners have been executed in the usa in the past seven years, including 58 in 1999. many on us death rows were too poor to afford a competent trial lawyer. race continues to play a prominent role in who lives and who dies, with a death sentence the more likely outcome when the defendant is black, and/or the victim white. the most recent execution in alabama, that of brian baldwin on 18 june 1999, went ahead despite widespread concern that his sentence was infected by racism and prosecutorial and police misconduct (extra 71/99 issued 15 june 1999). he, too, was 18 at the time of his crime, black, indigent and convicted of killing a white person. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. any death sentence is an affront to human dignity; any execution serves only to deepen a culture of violence in society.

""in looking at this case, there were no circumstances under which i would grant clemency,"" johanns said. ""there is a point at which a case of this nature comes to an end....the board does not serve as an appellate process."" when johanns announced the board was denying a hearing, audrey lamm, the 21-year-old daughter of one of reeves's victims, burst into tears in the front row. she and her father, gus, came to nebraska from their home in oregon to publicly plead for reeves's life. she attempted to address the meeting but was ruled out of order by the governor. secretary of state scott moore, who visited reeves at the state penitentiary, asked that the board grant some time for reflection by waiting until wednesday (13 january) to vote on the application for clemency. when that was denied, moore requested a 15-minute recess to gather his thoughts before casting his vote on the clemency motion. after the decision was announced, supporters of clemency confronted the new governor. ""governor, please don't do this to my mother. please,"" pleaded audrey lamm. don reeves, the condemned mans father, told johanns he should consider ""the unfairness of the system"" that sends some murderers to their deaths while others who commit equally heinous crimes are allowed to live. frank lamere of south sioux city, a winnebago indian, spoke of native american values and traditions in asking johanns to spare reeves, a member of the omaha tribe.

"97/10","13-year-old boy to be tried in juvenile court on 23 august, a pennsylvania trial court ordered the immediate transfer of jordan browns case to a juvenile court for trial. this decision removes the risk of 13-year-old jordan brown being sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. such a sentence, when imposed on anyone under 18 years old at the time of the crime, violates international law. in its decision on 23 august, the trial court concluded that the transfer of this case to the juvenile division of this court will serve the public interest the court specially finds that the defendant is amenable to treatment, supervision, and rehabilitation as a juvenile after considering his age, mental capacity, maturity, whether he can be rehabilitated prior to the expiration of juvenile court jurisdiction. on 29 march 2010, the same trial court had denied a petition filed by jordan browns lawyers for transfer of the trial to juvenile court. testimony from the prosecutions psychiatric expert had concluded that since [jordan brown] would not take responsibility for his action, the prospects of rehabilitation within the juvenile court jurisdiction was not likely to be successful. this opinion was pivotal and found to be highly persuasive by the trial court, which then ruled that the boy should be tried in adult court. this decision was reversed by the pennsylvania superior court, ruling that the manner in which the trial court had applied the law had violated jordan browns right not to incriminate himself. the trial court, it concluded, had effectively required the boy to admit guilt or accept responsibility for the crime with which he has been charged in order to show that he was capable of rehabilitation. following a new transfer hearing held on 5 august 2011, the trial court granted jordan browns petition for transfer of his case from adult criminal court to juvenile court. evidence from the previous hearing was reintroduced with the exception of the prosecutions psychiatric expert testimony. the prosecution did not present new expert testimony. the only additional evidence introduced at the new hearing was a stipulation by his lawyers that jordan brown continues to respond well at the juvenile center where he has been held since shortly after his arrest. jordan browns lawyers have sent the following message to amnesty international members: on behalf of jordan brown we want to thank all the many people, who in connection with amnesty international, have worked so hard and so diligently to raise people's awareness of this situation and to encourage our public officials to send this matter to juvenile court. aged 11 at the time of the crime, jordan brown had been automatically charged for trial in an adult court, as required by pennsylvania law for cases involving murder. he has been charged with two counts of homicide, because the victim, kenzie houk, was eight-and-a-half months pregnant and her unborn child also died. if tried in adult court and convicted of first-degree murder, jordan brown would have been automatically sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. he will remain in juvenile detention pending further proceedings. the juvenile justice system would have jurisdiction over him until he reaches the age of 21. many thanks to all who sent appeals. no further action is required.
