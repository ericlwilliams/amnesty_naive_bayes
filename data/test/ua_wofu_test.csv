mohiuddin ahmed, akm mohiuddin ahmed, and bazlul huda. syed farooq-ur rahman and sultan shahriar rashid khan have not yet requested clemency. lawyers say mercy petitions are normally considered after all the judicial processes are over, not in parallel with them. the prisoners are all on death row in dhaka central jail in the capital of bangladesh. the killing of sheikh mujibur rahman and his family members were grave human rights abuses, and those who committed them should be brought to justice. however, this should not be done through executions, because the death penalty itself is a violation of every persons human rights and is a cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, and anywhere in the world, regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. the death penalty violates the right to life as proclaimed in the universal declaration of human rights. background information sheikh mujibur rahman and most of his family members were killed when a group of military officers entered his house and opened fire on them in an attempted coup on august 15th 1975. then acting president kondaker mushtaq ahmed and his successor, president ziaur rahman, had granted the accused officers immunity from prosecution. it was lifted by sheikh hasina when she became prime minister in 1996 removing the legal barrier against the prosecution of suspects. on 8 november 1998, a dhaka court sentenced 15 of the 20 men accused of the murders to death. they were syed farooq-ur rahman, sultan shahriar rashid khan, muhiuddin ahmed, akm mahiuddin ahmed, bazlul huda, khandaker abdur rashid, shariful haque dalim, ahmed shariful hossain, am rashed chowdhury, shmb noor chowdhury, md abdul aziz pasha, md kismat hashem, nazmul hossain ansar, abdul mazed, and moslemuddin. the case went for an appeal hearing to the high court and on 14 december 2000, the high court delivered a split verdict. one judge upheld the death sentence for 10 of them and acquitted the other five. a second judge upheld the death sentences on all 15 defendants. the case then went for another hearing to a different high court judge who delivered the final verdict on 30 april 2001, upholding the death sentence for 12 of the defendants. the other three, who were acquitted, were md kismat hashem, ahmed shariful hossain, and nazmul hossain ansar. five of those convicted who are already in detention in the dhaka central jail appealed to the supreme court against their death sentences. they are syed farooq-ur rahman, sultan shahriar rashid khan, mohiuddin ahmed, akm mohiuddin ahmed, and bazlul huda. the supreme court upheld their sentences on 19 november 2009, leaving a final review of the case (scheduled for 24 january 2010) as the last judicial remedy open to these five men. prisoners sentenced to death in bangladesh can appeal to the high court against their conviction. if the high court upholds the sentence they can appeal to the supreme court. if the supreme court upholds the sentence, the prisoners have one more judicial remedy open to them and that is a final review of the supreme court verdict by the same bench of the supreme court. if the death sentence is still upheld, the only remedy open to the prisoners is a mercy petition requesting clemency from the president. the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 62/149 on 18 december 2007, calling for a worldwide moratorium on executions. the resolution was adopted by an overwhelming majority of 104 un member states in favor, 54 countries against and 29 abstentions. although not legally binding, the un resolution on the moratorium on executions carries considerable moral and political weight. the resolution is a reminder of member states commitment to work towards abolition of the death penalty. it is also an important tool to encourage retentionist countries to review their use of the death penalty. another resolution on the death penalty was adopted by the un general assembly on 18 december 2008 on the implementation of the 2007 unga resolution 62/149. 106 countries voted in favor, 46 against and 34 abstentions. bangladesh should joint the ever increasing community of nations who declare a moratorium on executions. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: -

penalty / legal concern usa (ohio)  john george spirko (m), white, aged 61 john spirko is scheduled to be executed in ohio on 24 january. he was sentenced to death in 1984 for the abduction and murder of betty jane mottinger in 1982. john spirko has consistently maintained his innocence of this crime and is seeking a pardon from the state governor or commutation of his death sentence to time served. he has been incarcerated for 25 years, 23 of them on death row. on the morning of 9 august 1982, 48-year-old betty jane mottinger went missing from the post office in the small rural community of elgin in van wert county in north-western ohio where she worked as postmistress. six weeks later, her body was found in a field in a neighboring county. she had been stabbed multiple times, was fully dressed, and was wrapped in a paint-splattered cloth tied with a rope. government investigators found nothing that led them to john spirko. recent dna testing conducted by the state has revealed nothing to link spirko to the crime. in the words of judge ronald gilman of the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit in 2004, a striking fact about the record in this case is the complete absence of any forensic evidence linking spirko to the crime. there are no fingerprints, footprints, fibers, blood, or stolen items to bolster the states case. nor is there any written or recorded confession of guilt by spirko. judge gilman also noted that two jailhouse informants who claimed that spirko had admitted to them his involvement in the crime have since recanted their testimony. it was the words of john spirko himself, however, which effectively put him on death row. on 9 october 1982, spirko, who was on parole from kentucky prison at the time, was arrested in toledo (about 180 kms from elgin) on an assault incident. two weeks later, he was caught trying to escape from jail, and he and his girlfriend, who had aided his escape attempt, were facing the possibility of prison terms. john spirko decided to contact the authorities in relation to the mottinger murder, which was in the toledo media at the time following the collapse of the case against the only suspect. spirko told the authorities that he could provide information on the case in return for leniency for him and his girlfriend on the charges they were facing. over the following weeks, john spirko proceeded to tell the lead investigator in the case, paul hartman, a series of shifting stories about the mottinger crime. after each apparently false story led the investigator nowhere, spirko would provide another version. research conducted by the cleveland plain dealer newspaper in 2004 concluded that spirkos stories were shot through with contradictions, fabrications and what appear to be wild guesses  many of them wrong  about the facts of the case and theres not a shred of evidence that any of the over the following weeks, john spirko proceeded to tell the lead investigator in the case, paul hartman, a series of shifting stories about the mottinger crime. after each apparently false story led the investigator nowhere, spirko would provide another version. research conducted by the cleveland plain dealer newspaper in 2004 concluded that spirkos stories were shot through with contradictions, fabrications and what appear to be wild guesses  many of them wrong  about the facts of the case and theres not a shred of evidence that any of the stories ever happened. in his 2004 dissent, judge gilman noted that the record leaves no doubt about spirkos falsifications, adding that lying is not a capital offense. in addition, the credibility of paul hartman  the states lead witness  has been severely damaged in recent years. in january 1983, paul hartman interviewed john spirko for at least the 12th time. this time, after being prompted by hartman, john spirko named delaney gibson, with whom he had shared a prison cell in kentucky, and who like spirko had a violent criminal record. a resident of elgin, opal seibert, who had seen a car pull up outside the post-office on the morning of betty jane mottingers disappearance and seen a clean-shaven man get out and stand by the car for a few minutes before driving away, identified gibson as this man from a years-old photograph of gibson that the investigators had obtained. armed with opal sieberts testimony and spirkos story implicating gibson and, according to the authorities, himself, in the murder, prosecutors indicted gibson and spirko for the capital murder of betty jane mottinger. john spirko was brought to trial in august 1984. opal siebert, who has since died, testified that gibson was the man she had seen outside the elgin post office. another witness testified, but with only 70 per cent certainty, that a stranger he saw could have been spirko, although the description the witness had given of the man did not match spirko. the prosecutor argued that spirko and gibson had abducted and killed betty jane mottinger. john spirko was convicted and sentenced to death. gibson neither appeared at spirkos trial, nor was he himself ever brought to trial for this crime. his indictment was dismissed by van wert county two decades later on 17 may 2004, the same day that the sixth circuit rejected spirkos appeal. what neither spirkos trial lawyers nor his jury knew was that investigators had discovered that delaney gibson had a very strong alibi. photographic and other documentary evidence showed that gibson was some 800 kilometers away in north carolina, and fully bearded, at least until the evening before the mottinger murder, and that he was on his job picking tomatoes in north carolina on 10 august 1982. this alibi evidence remained hidden for the next 13 years until it was provided to john spirkos appeal lawyers. they appealed on the grounds that prosecutors had knowingly presented false evidence and a false theory of the case at the trial, and had denied spirko due process by withholding exculpatory evidence from him. in its ruling on 17 may 2004, a three-judge panel of the sixth circuit upheld john spirkos conviction and death sentence by a vote of two to one. the majority held that spirko had not proved that he had been prejudiced by the states failure to disclose gibsons alibi evidence. it concluded that spirkos statements to hartman had contained information about the crime not in the public domain, and therefore demonstrated intimate knowledge of the case. both the research by the clein its ruling on 17 may 2004, a three-judge panel of the sixth circuit upheld john spirkos conviction and death sentence by a vote of two to one. the majority held that spirko had not proved that he had been prejudiced by the states failure to disclose gibsons alibi evidence. it concluded that spirkos statements to hartman had contained information about the crime not in the public domain, and therefore demonstrated intimate knowledge of the case. both the research by the cleveland plain dealer and spirkos lawyers repudiate this, arguing that the details of the crime that john spirko relayed to investigators had already appeared in the ohio media. in addition, numerous details of the crime and victim that he provided were wrong. judge gilman, dissenting, said that the case against spirko is far from overwhelming and based on evidence that has a foundation of sand. he argued that the withheld alibi evidence was favorable to spirko and that he should receive a full evidentiary hearing on that issue. in addition, there is compelling evidence that john spirko was in toledo for a meeting with his parole officer at the time the abduction of betty jane mottinger was taking place. amnesty international supports john spirkos bid for clemency. indeed, on the basis of the information contained in his clemency petition and in the cleveland plain dealers research, the organization believes that the governor should seriously consider granting john spirko at least a conditional pardon, which is allowed under ohio law and which would allow the state to retry him for the mottinger murder if it has the evidence to do so. as the case currently stands, his execution would contravene international standards which require that the death penalty not be carried out in any case where the conviction is in doubt. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. there have been 1,099 executions in the usa since 1977, 26 of them in ohio. there appears to be a de facto moratorium on lethal injections in the usa while the us supreme court considers a challenge to that method of execution. however, no announcement of a judicial moratorium has been made, and any scheduled lethal injection has to be challenged. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - explaining that you are not seeking to excuse betty jane mottingers death or to downplay the suffering caused, but opposing the execution of john spirko; - expressing serious concern about the reliability of his conviction and the fact that neither his trial lawyers nor the jury had access to evidence that contradicted the prosecutions

both require egypt to provide international protection to refugees. according to a 1954 memorandum of understanding between egypt and unhcr, the egyptian authorities are obliged to allow asylum-seekers to meet with unhcr representatives and to respect unhcrs assessments of their refugee status. egypt is currently the vice-chair of the unhcr executive committee, governing the organization. unfair trials are rife in sudan. between may 2008 and june 2010, amnesty international documented more than 120 death sentences that were passed following unfair trials. in recent years and particularly since may 2008 when the darfur-based armed opposition group justice and equality movement (jem) attacked the sudanese capital, khartoum, amnesty international has documented many cases of arbitrary and incommunicado detention, torture and other ill-treatment, and extrajudicial executions at the hands of the national intelligence and security services (niss) in sudan, on the basis of their ethnicity or suspected political allegiance. in the months that followed the jem attack on khartoum, darfuris were the main targets of human rights violations committed by the niss. amnesty international has recorded several cases of arbitrary detention, torture and one case of extrajudicial execution in 2010, including among members of the opposition and human rights activists. six people, mainly idps living in khartoum, were executed in january 2010 following unfair trials where their confessions were reportedly extracted under torture. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   urging the egyptian authorities not to forcibly return faisal mohammed haroun suleiman to sudan;

he has not been seen since. family members were able to contact him on his mobile phone on 20 february, and he told them that he was going to butwal for a few days. they contacted him again on 25 february, but he was reluctant to speak and told them not to phone again. on 27 february three uniformed soldiers came to search the family home, and left with a photograph of prabhu ram kc. reports suggest that he is held at shree jang gan army camp, in singha durbar, in kathmandu. yamanath lohani is a resident of ward no.9, thananpati village development committee, in nuwakot district. he had been visiting family in kathmandu on 29 february, and had to return to his village for a teacher training course the next day, so he caught the bus home at 8am on 1 march. at 10.30am the bus stopped for a routine check at fhusredada, near the shivapuri army camp in the northern end of the kathmandu valley. there were between 10 and 15 soldiers manning the post, and they told yamanath lohani to remain behind for questioning, saying that they would put him on a later bus. the reasons for his arrest are not known, and his family strongly deny that he had any links with the communist party of nepal (cpn) (maoist), as he was a member of the cpn-united marxist-leninist (uml), a mainstream political party who were the principle opposition party prior to the dissolution of parliament by the king in october 2002. reports suggest that he may be being held at gha gul army barracks in shivapuri, a commando training facility. efforts to locate all three men by relatives, including informing the national human rights commission, have so far been unsuccessful. background information amnesty international has been concerned about a deterioration in the human rights situation in nepal since the cpn (maoist) launched a peoples war in february 1996. reports of human rights abuses by both the security forces and the cpn (maoist) escalated after the army was mobilized and a state of emergency imposed between november 2001 and august 2002. many people were arrested under the 2002 terrorist and disruptive activities (control and punishment) act, which gave the security forces the power to arrest without warrant and detain suspects in police custody for up to 90 days. scores of people are reported to have been held for weeks or even months in illegal army custody without access to their families, lawyers or medical treatment. in 2002, nepal recorded the highest number of  disappearances of any country in the world. the cpn (maoist) are also reported to have abducted scores of people. on 29 january 2003, both sides agreed to a ceasefire. three rounds of peace talks were held - in april, may and august - between the government and representatives of the cpn (maoist). among the cpn (maoist)'s central demands were a round table conference, the formation of an interim government and elections to a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution. the cpn (maoist) announced they were withdrawing from the ceasefire agreement as of 27 august 2003. since then, fighting has resumed throughout the country, and amnesty international has received reports of both sides committing human rights abuses. in particular there has been a rise in the number of "" disappearances"" at the hands of the security forces and abductions by the cpn (maoist). recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing concern for the safety of shita ram dhakal, prabhu ram kc and yamanath lohani, who were reportedly arrested in kathmandu district between 11 january and 1 march;

robbery and murder of shopkeeper minh rogers and the rape and murder of her 16-year-old daughter, linda rogers, on 18 august 1990. his lawyers have questioned the reliability of his conviction, and are seeking new dna testing. according to the evidence heard at trial, the bodies of minh and linda rogers were found on the morning of 19 august 1990 by an employee at the family-run store, rogers grocery, outside gatesville, north carolina. jerry conner was interrogated by police on 31 august, and told them that on or around 13 august, after he had been fired from his job as a truck driver, he had talked with a black man who had offered him $7,000 to kill a japanese woman who ran a store in gates county (in fact minh rogers was vietnamese). he said that he had rejected the offer, but later went back to try to find the man. conner said that he had not found the man, but decided to kill the woman and attempt to collect the money later. he said that he had shot minh rogers, raped and shot linda rogers, and stolen money from the store. three witnesses who had been in the grocerys car park on the evening of 18 august testified that they had seen minh rogers leave the store with a white male, talk briefly with him and then go back into the store. the man had then taken a shotgun from his white car and told the witnesses that he was a federal law enforcement officer involved in a drugs seizure, and warned them that they should leave the area. at the trial, the three identified jerry conner as this man. in his statement to the police, jerry conner did not recall having identified himself as a law enforcement officer, and in any event he later changed his story, saying he had been in rogers grocery store earlier on 18 august, and had been teased by the woman owner and a white male. he said that he returned to the store later that evening after drinking large amounts of whiskey, challenged the white male to a fight and, after the man had refused and left, had killed minh and linda rogers as he previously related. jerry conners 1991 trial resulted in the death penalty. this was overturned on appeal because of an error during jury selection. at a re-sentencing hearing in 1995, he was again sentenced to death. conners lawyers have raised doubts about his conviction given the inconsistencies in his statements to the police, which were made under the threat of the death penalty. an expert who has reviewed the statements and the trial testimony of the interrogating officers, and factored in conners borderline mental retardation and psychological make-up, has raised serious doubts about the credibility of the confession. the jury did not hear testimon conners lawyers have raised doubts about his conviction given the inconsistencies in his statements to the police, which were made under the threat of the death penalty. an expert who has reviewed the statements and the trial testimony of the interrogating officers, and factored in conners borderline mental retardation and psychological make-up, has raised serious doubts about the credibility of the confession. the jury did not hear testimony from another witness who said that she had seen a white male arguing with minh rogers outside the store on the evening of 18 august and that there were other males in a blue vehicle with the man. this witness said that the man she had seen was not conner. the state conducted dna testing on the semen evidence from the crime but it was inconclusive. conners lawyers are seeking new dna testing using modern techniques which can provide significantly more proof of identity. the state has so far refused to carry out these tests. one of the jurors at the 1995 re-sentencing was a journalist who had covered the 1991 trial. during jury selection she was asked whether she had heard this case discussed by any person who indicated direct or firsthand knowledge of the facts about the case. she replied that she had not. on appeal, conners lawyers presented affidavits from an investigator and two law students who alleged that the journalist had told them that during her reporting of the 1991 trial she had obtained information from officials that had not been made available to the public, including victim impact evidence of how minh rogerss 14-year-old son had reacted to his mothers death. dissenting against his two colleagues decision to uphold the death sentence in 2005, judge michael luttig of the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit wrote: here, the circumstances that conner alleges plainly establish the risk of actual bias. he alleges that juror knight engaged in confidential conversations about his case with investigators and a key trial witness, and that these conversations included victim impact evidence highly relevant to the sentencing trial in which knight sat as a juror. these allegations raise the obvious possibility that knight relied on such extraneous evidence (and other yet undisclosed communications) in her deliberation about whether to sentence conner to death. such would constitute a quintessential instance of actual juror bias. judge luttig concluded that conner should receive a new sentencing. background information amnesty international takes no position on the guilt or innocence of jerry conner, and opposes his death sentence in any case, as it does in all cases everywhere. nevertheless, the organization notes the high error rate in capital cases in the usa  since 1973, 123 people have been released from death row in 25 states on grounds of innocence. in 15 of these cases, dna testing played a substantial role in the exoneration. the cases illustrated the widespread problem of inadequate defense representation and prosecutors failing to reveal exculpatory evidence. in the usa, the innocence project has revealed that false confessions were present in 27 per cent of the first 130 criminal cases across the country in which dna evidence exonerated the convicted person. in 78 per cent of the 130 cases, mistaken identification was a factor. today, 123 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice, recognizing its inherent flaws. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, it has put 1,021 men and women to death (of which north carolina accounts for 42). there have been 17 executions in the usa this year. for

penalty / legal concern usa (texas)         cathy lynn henderson (f), white, aged 50 cathy henderson is scheduled to be executed in texas on 13 june. she was sentenced to death in may 1995 for the murder of a three-and-a-half-month-old baby, brandon baugh, in january 1994. on the morning of 21 january 1994, brandon baugh's parents left him with cathy henderson, who was the daily caregiver, at her home in pflugerville, near austin, texas. when the childs mother returned to collect him later in the day, both he and cathy henderson had disappeared. the fbi arrested cathy henderson in kansas city, missouri, on 1 february 1994. cathy henderson admitted that she had killed the child, but stated that it had been an accident, which she has maintained ever since. she said that she had dropped the baby and that he had struck his head on a concrete floor. she said that after her efforts to resuscitate him had been unsuccessful, she had panicked, buried the babys body and fled to missouri, her native state. after the body was located on 8 february, cathy henderson was charged with capital murder. under the texas penal code, the murder of a child under six years old is punishable by the death penalty. the jury heard expert opinion that the head injuries sustained by the baby could not have been the result of an accidental fall from the defendants arms. dr roberto bayardo, who conducted the autopsy, stated that the nature of the injuries proved that cathy henderson had deliberately murdered brandon baugh by a blow to the head. for example, he said that the baby would have to have fallen from a height higher than a two-storey building, or to have been involved in a motor vehicle accident in order to have sustained the head injury in question. dr sparks veasey suggested that the death had occurred as a result of the childs head impacting in an extremely forceful manner a blunt surface  a floor, counter top, a desk top, a wall. the prosecution provided no crime scene evidence to support such hypotheses offered by its experts. the analysis of the amount of ""force"" necessary to break or shatter an object, including a skull, requires expertise in the sciences of physics and engineering, rather than medicine, and this has led to the science of biomechanical analysis. prior to the trial, the defense lawyers had sought funds to hire an expert to conduct a biomechanical investigation of cathy hendersons claim that the babys death had been accidental. the request was denied. the jury convicted cathy henderson of capital child murder and after finding that she would pose a danger to society if allowed to live, voted for execution. in an appeal just filed in the texas court of criminal appeals, cathy hendersons current lawyers point out that the biomechanical analysis of infant head trauma has developed substantially in the dozen years since her trial. witin an appeal just filed in the texas court of criminal appeals, cathy hendersons current lawyers point out that the biomechanical analysis of infant head trauma has developed substantially in the dozen years since her trial. with accompanying reports from four experts, the appeal argues that the trial of cathy henderson would today be conducted against a fundamentally different scientific landscape than existed in 1995. for example, in his report, dr peter stephens states that biomechanical consultation and testimony is essential to the understanding of any impact injury to the head, and is mandatory for any case proceeding to litigation, civil or criminal i would not contemplate assigning a cause and manner of death in any controversial case involving head injury without obtaining, or recommending consulting, a biomechanical evaluation. dr john plunkett, a forensic pathologist with an expertise in infant head trauma, states that while he agrees with the experts at trial that an impact injury caused brandon baughs death, dr bayardos conclusions were wrong and that he had strayed from his area of medical competence and expertise when he opined about the amount of force sustained by brandon baugh, and opined that this force could not have been sustained accidentally. dr plunkett notes that the trial transcripts indicate that none of the medical witnesses in ms hendersons trial understood [the science of biomechanics]. dr plunkett states that he has reviewed at least two cases of accidental falls of less than four and half feet involving infants that caused fractures virtually identical to brandons. dr stephens concurs, stating that since 2000, physicians have increasingly recognized that lethal injury to the infant can, and does, occur from an accidental fall, even of a short distance it is simply incorrect to state that only a fall from a bunk bed, balcony, or upper story window can cause such an injury. forensic pathologists, biomechanical scientists and many pediatricians now agree that such comparisons are without scientific merit and should not be made. in her report on the case, dr janice ophoven notes: in the past, the characteristics of a fracture of the type seen in brandon were assumed to denote an abusive injury. however, current scientific experience reflects a more conservative analytical approach to skull fracture evaluation. the nature of the fracture itself cannot be used to determine whether the injury is due to an accident or inflicted injury. fourthly, dr kenneth monson, a leading biomechanics expert, states that the force at which brandon baughs skull would have hit the floor under cathy hendersons version of events was enough to cause the injury that killed him. the accidental death of brandon baugh, he states, cannot be ruled out given the current state of knowledge. the large number of errors discovered in capital cases in the usa over recent years may have been one of the factors contributing to a lessening in public support for this irrevocable punishment. science has played its part in revealing such errors. for example, in 15 of the 124 cases of prisoners released from death rows since 1973 on grounds of wrongful conviction, dna testing played a substantial role in establishing the inmates innocence. in each of these cases at the original trial, the prosecution had argued, and the jury or judge had found, that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. in some cases, the state had supported its theory of guilt with expert evidence. for example, in texas, investigators concluded that a house fire that killed two people in 1986 was arson, and ernest willis was sentenced to death. post-conviction investigations using modern methods concluded that there was no evidence of arson, and willis was released after more than 15 years on death row. in mississippi, sabrina butler was acquitted at a retrial in 1995, five years after she was sentenced to death for the murder of her nine-month-old child. it is now believed that the baby may have died either of cystic kidney disease or from sudden infant death syndrome. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 1,076 prisoners have been put to death, 11 of them women. there have been 393 executions in texas, three of them of women. there have been 19 executions in 2007, 14 of them in texas. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. today, 129 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state that capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in

this honor which requires them to show a sense of propriety and discretion vis--vis anything that can cause harm to their country. they have not respected the sacro-sanctity and inviolability of the country. in practice, anyone who challenges this image risks becoming a target for the security forces. human rights activists in tunisia operate in the face of harassment and intimidation. many have reported being under constant surveillance by the security forces, and have also reported being prevented from traveling abroad or within the country, in breach of right to freedom of movement. some have also reported being beaten up, reportedly by men in civilian clothes who appeared to be agents of the security forces. the authorities have consistently refused to accept human rights organizations applications for legal registration, without which they are technically not allowed to operate. they have interfered in the activities of the few that are officially registered, in some cases staging internal takeovers by government supporters. tunisian activists who have spoken out against the authorities human rights record while abroad have been harassed and interrogated upon their return to tunisia. several have been denied permission to travel abroad again. the minister of foreign affairs has responsibility for maintaining tunisia's international standing. amnesty international believes that international appeals made directly to the minister may convince him that the authorities should abandon the proposed change to the legislation, as it would harm tunisias official public image. the ministry of justice and human rights has responsibility for overseeing the drafting of proposed legislation. the minister is well placed to take action on amnesty international's concerns, and would be expected to raise them with the other members of the tunisian government. the tunisian authorities have recently hired the services of a usa-based public relations firm to improve the image of tunisia abroad. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   calling on the tunisia authorities to withdraw the proposed additions to article 61bis of the penal code;

133/2001 legal concern         1 june 2001 usa (florida)         lionel tate, black, aged 14 lionel tate recently began a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, for a crime committed in 1999 when he was 12 years old. his sentence violates international law. his lawyers have filed a clemency petition to the governor of florida, and amnesty international is calling for lionel tates sentence to be commuted and his treatment brought into line with international standards. on 25 january, lionel tate was convicted as an adult of the first-degree murder of his playmate, six-year-old tiffany eunick, who was killed on 28 july 1999. the jury rejected the defense claim that the 12-year-old boy had accidentally killed the much smaller girl while mimicking professional wrestling moves that he had seen on television. prior to the trial, the defense rejected the prosecutions offer of a sentence of three years in juvenile detention, followed by a year of house arrest and 10 years of probation, in return for a plea of guilty to second-degree murder. at his sentencing on 10 march, lionel tate received the mandatory prison sentence under florida law of life without parole. if the sentence is not reduced on appeal or by executive clemency, he will die in prison. lionel tates sentence violates the principle that the states treatment of children who commit crimes, however serious, must focus on the possibility of the childs rehabilitation and successful reintegration into society. indeed, under international standards, maximizing this possibility should be one of the primary guiding principles motivating the states response. article 37(a) of the convention on the rights of the child (crc) states: neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age. while the usa is one of only two countries (the other being somalia), which have not ratified this treaty (191 countries have), it has signed it. as such, it has bound itself under international law not to do anything which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty, pending the decision on whether to ratify it. article 37(b) of the crc calls upon states to use imprisonment against a child only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. article 40 calls upon states to treat children found to have violated the law in a way that takes into account the childs age and the desirability of promoting the childs reintegration and the childs assuming a constructive role in society. article 14(4) of the international covenant on civil and political rights, which the usa ratified in 1992, states: in the case of juvenile persons, the procedure shall be such as will take account of their age and the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation. the un rules for the protection of juveniles deprived of their liberty furthermore state that any such deprivation should only be under conditions that guarantee  meaningful activities and programmes which would serve to promote and sustain [the juveniles] health and self-respect, to foster their sense of responsibility and encourage those attitudes and skills that will assist them in developing their potential as members of society. in florida, the governor has the unfettered discretion to grant clemency with the approval of at least three members of the cabinet. the governor could call a special clemency meeting on the case at any time. lionel tates clemency petition, including a letter from amnesty international, reached governor bush on 1 june. in such cases, the organization does not specify in detail what sentence is appropriate, only that it should conform to international standards. this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. background information during the past two decades in the usa, in response to public concern about crimes committed by young people, federal and state governments have significantly expanded the role of the general criminal justice system with respect to children and increased the severity of sanctions that courts may impose on children. the growing tendency in the usa to prosecute and punish children as if they were adults, rather than in the separate juvenile justice system, is inconsistent with the approach encouraged by international standards, that governments should establish laws, procedures, authorities and institutions specifically for children. there are many people in the usa serving life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for crimes committed when they were under 18. amnesty international knows of none from this group who was as young as lionel tate at the time of the offence. his case is therefore starkly illustrative of a wider problem, and the organization is taking this action as part of its efforts to persuade us authorities to bring their country into line with international standards on the treatment of child offenders. his sentence should be commuted as a matter of urgency and the states efforts turned towards maximizing his chance for successful reintegration into society at the earliest possible time, rather than throwing away the key. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: - expressing sympathy for tiffany eunicks family, explaining that you are not seeking to belittle her tragic death or the suffering it has caused; - expressing concern, however, that lionel tate, who was 12 years old at the time, has been given a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, which violates international law; - noting that the sentence has received widespread international attention, being out of step with commonly held views of juvenile justice, and that such cases are damaging floridas, and the usas, reputation in the world; - calling for the sentence to be commuted and that the states response be

death penalty usa (oklahoma)          terry lyn short (m), white, aged 48 terry short is scheduled to be executed in oklahoma on 17 june. he was sentenced to death in 1997 for the murder of ken yamamoto in january 1995. ken yamamoto, a japanese student, was living in an apartment in oklahoma city that was located directly above the apartment where brenda gardner, her sister tammy gardner and the latters two young children lived. terry short was brenda gardners boyfriend until they broke up in late december 1994. in the early hours of 8 january 2005, a fire broke out in the gardners apartment. brenda and tammy gardner escaped with the children, but the fire spread to the apartment above where ken yamamoto was sleeping. he was taken to hospital with burns to 95 per cent of his body. he died a few hours later. terry short was charged with throwing a firebomb through the patio door of the gardners apartment, causing the fire that killed ken yamamoto. he was also charged with five counts of attempted murder  of the two gardner sisters, the children and robert hines, who was visiting their apartment at the time. at the trial, the state presented eyewitness testimony from brenda gardner and robert hines. gardner testified that she had seen terry short outside the apartment just before the fire, although she had not seen him throw the alleged firebomb. hines said that he had seen short outside the apartment, but admitted that he had only assumed it was short because the gardners had said that he had been outside the apartment earlier. the state presented an expert who said that a molotov cocktail had been thrown into the apartment. another expert testified for the defense that in her opinion the fire scene was not consistent with a firebomb having started the fire. the state also presented the testimony of jay brown, a jailhouse informant, who said that terry short had admitted to him in jail that he had started the fire after finding hines and brenda gardner having sex, and that short had scrawled derogatory comments about gardner on the wall of the jail cell. browns testimony was given in return for leniency on charges he was facing. the defense lawyers sought to present the testimony of another inmate, mark bayless, who had also shared the jail cell, and who they said would refute every single word that jay brown testified to. however, the trial judge refused to allow bayless to testify because the defense had revealed too late to the prosecution their intention to present him. in its ruling on the case in 2006, the us court of appeals for the 10in its ruling on the case in 2006, the us court of appeals for the 10th circuit said that browns testimony was relevant to the prosecution because it served as the only testimony from an unrelated party directly connecting mr short to the crime. it found that the testimony of mark bayless, if true and credible, would have been similarly relevant and could have served to impeach browns credibility. it further stated that the exclusion of relevant, probative, and otherwise admissible evidence is an extreme sanction that should be used only when justified by some overriding policy consideration. the 10th circuit noted that there was no evidence that the defense had acted in bad faith in failing to disclose their intention to present bayless. indeed, the defense had suggested to the trial judge that the remedy for their tardy disclosure would be to grant the prosecution time to interview bayless or to grant a recess in proceedings. in addition, the 10th circuit said that shorts interest in having the bayless testimony presented was significantly heightened by the fact that he was facing the death penalty. however, noting that the constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one the 10th circuit court concluded that although the exclusion of the bayless testimony deprived the jury of relevant evidence, federal judicial review was required to be deferential to state court decisions, and it upheld the conviction. browns testimony was exploited at the sentencing by the prosecutor, who told the jury that in jail [short] bragged about how hed thrown a fire bomb. in addition, highly emotional victim impact testimony was presented by ken yamamotos mother at the sentencing. indeed, the state court of criminal appeals found in 1999 that this testimony had come very close to weighting the scales too far on the side of the prosecution by so intensely focusing on the emotional impact of the victims loss. one of the judges in that decision wrote a separate opinion referring to this especially troubling aspect of the case. however the court upheld the death sentence, as did the federal 10th circuit despite acknowledging that the mothers testimony was troubling, contained irrelevant information and that much of it was highly emotional. the oklahoma court of criminal appeals chastised the prosecutor for arguing that the jury should vote for execution rather than a prison sentence because it was not justice to allow the defendant three meals a day, a clean place to sleep, and visits by his friends while the victims mother daily grieves for her only son. the then oklahoma county district attorney, robert macy, who prosecuted terry short, was repeatedly condemned for such misconduct by the appeal courts

to death for the 1998 murder of claudia benton, a doctor in houston. he is also believed to have committed a series of murders in several other us states. there is compelling evidence that angel maturino resndiz suffers from serious mental illness, including paranoid schizophrenia. his lawyers are arguing that he is incompetent for execution  that is, that he does not understand the reason for, or reality of, his punishment  and that his execution would therefore violate the us constitution. at the trial in 2000, the defence argued that angel maturino resndiz was not guilty by reason of insanity, in other words that he did not know right from wrong at the time of the murder. for the defence, an expert testified that maturino resndiz was suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia, producing the delusion that he was an angel of god with a duty to destroy evil people. the prosecutions experts did not dispute that he was mentally ill  and their testing found evidence of brain damage  but they testified that, in their opinion, he was not legally insane at the time of the crime. no determination had been made of his competency to stand trial: the capacity of the defendant to understand the proceedings and to consult rationally with his attorney in presenting a defence. however, a pre-trial psychological evaluation reported that angel maturino resndiz stated with great vehemence that he wanted to be his own attorney, that he wanted to plead guilty and that he wanted to be put to death. he explained that if this course of events occurred, he would be victorious because he would return to live on this earth whereas the judge, the jury and the executioner would all die instantly when he was put to death. throughout the trial proceedings, antipsychotic drugs were administered to subdue the symptoms of his mental illness. after the jury rejected the insanity defence and found him guilty, maturino resndiz asked to be sentenced to death. he instructed his court-appointed attorneys not to make an opening statement at the penalty phase of his trial, not to cross-examine the states witnesses and to present no testimony on his behalf. in the six years that angel maturino resndiz has been on death row, his mental condition has continued to deteriorate. he has been transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit on eight different occasions, has mutilated himself more than 30 times, and has been placed on antipsychotic medication to control his auditory hallucinations and delusions. a recent assessment by a psychiatrist found that angel maturino resndiz is completely delusional, convinced that as a man-angel he is immune from lethal injection and will awaken unha in the six years that angel maturino resndiz has been on death row, his mental condition has continued to deteriorate. he has been transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit on eight different occasions, has mutilated himself more than 30 times, and has been placed on antipsychotic medication to control his auditory hallucinations and delusions. a recent assessment by a psychiatrist found that angel maturino resndiz is completely delusional, convinced that as a man-angel he is immune from lethal injection and will awaken unharmed with a renovated body ( cuerpo renovado ) on the third day following his execution. a psychologist also recently concluded that the prisoner suffers from schizophrenia, and that he does not believe he will die as a result of execution. in addition, angel maturino resndiz  who suffered a childhood in mexico marked by mental illness in his family and by appalling deprivation and abuse  was denied his internationally-recognized right to adequate legal representation on appeal. his appeal lawyer filed a petition raising a single generic claim, failing to make any reference to the prisoners mental illness, and not even mentioning him by name. it was later discovered that this petition was identical, word-for-word, to a brief filed in the appeal of another death row prisoner. the appeal lawyer also missed a crucial deadline for filing in angel maturino resndizs case, with the result that under federal law the prisoner forfeited his right to further review of case-specific issues, such as his mental illness. a petition has been filed with the inter-american commission on human rights, asserting that the execution of angel maturino resndiz would violate the usas international human rights obligations. on 1 may 2006, the commission responded by issuing precautionary measures calling on the united states to take the steps necessary to preserve the petitioners life and physical integrity while his claims are under review. backround information the us supreme court has provided constitutional exemptions for some categories of mentally impaired people facing the death penalty. in 1986, the court ruled in ford v. wainwright that the execution of people who are legally insane violates the us constitutions prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. in reality, this has offered only minimal protection. in 2002, in atkins v. virginia , the supreme court prohibited the death penalty for people with mental retardation. the court reasoned that the impairments of defendants with mental retardation diminish their personal culpability and their ability to understand consequences, rendering the death penalty unjustifiable on grounds of retribution or deterrence. amnesty international believes that there is a profound inconsistency in exempting people with mental retardation from the death penalty while those with serious mental illness remain exposed to it. the same rationale of diminished culpability, greater vulnerability and limited capacity applies to defendants afflicted with severe mental illness. for further information, see ais recent report: usa: the execution of mentally ill offenders (amr 51/003/2006, january 2006),","","",1,FALSE

that although he preferred his segregation cell to being held with other inmates, he was lonely; and that he had been abandoned by his family. she said that he had no visitors, he had nobody. she said that knight would confide in her, and would call her mom. she said that she had reached the opinion that his possession of makeshift weapons was an indicator of his boredom rather than of any violent intent. she also said that, although knight did not talk much about the crime, and did not expect sympathy from her, he had said that he was going to take full responsibility for both murders even though robert bradfield had participated in one of them, because he knew that bradfields family would not cope if robert bradfield were to receive the death penalty. she said that she thought that patrick knight had, over time, begun to feel remorse about the crime because he got to the point where he understood really the gravity of what he had done. she did not think that he would be a future danger in prison, so long as he was kept in a controlled structured environment. the defense lawyers had known that the prosecution intended to call risley as a witness and that knight had spoken fondly of her. however, they had never contacted her. in the post-conviction proceedings, cynthia risley stated that she would have been available to talk to the defense. at the federal hearing, the trial lawyer acknowledged that, with hindsight, it would not have been a bad idea probably to interview the jailers who had come into contact with knight. in 2005, the us supreme court handed down a decision, rompilla v. beard, in which it held that even when a capital defendant and his family members have suggested that no mitigating evidence is available, his lawyer is bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and review material that counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of aggravation at the trials sentencing phase. the rompilla case involved defense counsel who had conducted mitigation investigation, including interviews with the family and mental health experts. however, their investigation had turned up little in mitigation. even so, the supreme court held that the legal representation had been deficient when the lawyers failed to examine the court file on rompillas criminal record that they knew the prosecution would use in seeking a death sentence. in an appeal to the supreme court, knights lawyer argued that the similarities between this case and rompilla are striking. both knights counsel and counsel in rompilla knew that the prosecution intended to use certain evidence as part of its aggravation case during the punishment phase. this evidence [risleys testimony] was readily available and easily investigated. however, the supreme court has refused to take the case. patrick knight comes from a highly dysfunctional family background. alcohol abuse was reportedly common in the family (knight had drunk large amounts of alcohol at the time of the crime). when knight was four years old, he was found at the bottom of a swimming pool with a tricycle on top of him. he required emergency hospitalization and experienced seizures for at least a year afterwards. from the age of nine, he was taken to psychologists on a number of occasions due to behavioral problems. at the age of 13 or 14, he dropped out of school. as patrick knights execution date has approached, his case has gained some notoriety because of his reported decision to collect jokes from which he intends to select one for his final statement. he has stated that by doing this he is not intending any disrespect to the murder victims. in a letter urging the texas board of pardons and paroles to allow the execution to go forward, the randall county criminal district attorney has asserted that knights obscene plan to recite a gag at the moment of execution gives the clemency process a bad name. amnesty international considers that whatever is motivating patrick knight, the texas clemency process has already earned a bad name for itself, having failed to prevent nearly 400 executions in the past 25 years, including of child offenders, prisoners with serious mental disabilities, people denied adequate legal representation, and those whose guilt remained in doubt to the end. there have been 1,080 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977. texas accounts for 394 of these executions. there have been 23 executions in the usa this year, 15 in texas. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family of walter and mary ann werner, explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of their deaths or to downplay the suffering caused;

was sentenced to death in 1999 for the 1997 murder of two young women. he has given up appeals against his conviction and death sentence. angela holmes, who was 21, was kidnapped together with 16-year-old michelle mace, at a baskin-robbins ice-cream shop in the town of clarksville on the night of 23 april 1997. their bodies were found the following day. both had been stabbed. at paul reids trial in september 1999, the jury convicted him of the murders. at the sentencing, the state presented the jury with victim impact testimony from family members of the murder victims, graphic descriptions and photographs of the knife wounds sustained by the two women, and evidence of the defendants prior convictions for murder (paul reid had already been sentenced to death for two other murders at a fast food restaurant in nashville in 1997, and in 2000 would be sentenced to death for three other murders that took place at a nashville mcdonalds in 1997). the defence presented expert mental health and medical testimony. a clinical psychologist testified that paul reid suffered from serious mental illness, including chronic schizophrenia, and had brain damage. a clinical neuropsychologist explained that reid had suffered a number of serious head injuries as a result of childhood abuse and accidents. a neurologist explained that brain scans had revealed several abnormalities in reids brain, including evidence of traumatic injury. the defence experts related how paul reid had long suffered from delusional beliefs, including that he was under government surveillance and control. the state presented a forensic psychiatrist who testified that in his opinion paul reid was malingering, although he conceded that reid had brain damage and a history of mental illness, including delusions. however, he testified that he could identify no link between these mental health issues and the crime. in closing arguments for a death sentence, the prosecutor placed the crime scene photographs of the murder victims on a projector and argued that paul reids mental illness had not been behind the crime, but his greed, using dollar bills to illustrate his point. the jury sentenced paul reid to death on 22 september 1999. in may 2005, the tennessee supreme court affirmed the conviction and sentences, rejecting the claims raised in his automatic direct appeal. since then, paul reid has dropped his appeals. his sister is appealing to the courts to grant her next friend status, and to have a lawyer appointed to his case, on the grounds that her brother is mentally incompetent to waive his appeals and to act on his own behalf. in an affidavit to the courts in support of her efforts to stop the execution, paul reids sister has said that her brother is severely mentally ill. he does not think or act in a rational manner. it seems that everything he does is guided by his belief in a government conspiracy against him to bombard him with scientific technology. when he has talked about giving up appeals and being executed, he talks about ending the torture of the scientific technology. additional affidavits from others involved in the case further describe reids mental problems. a neuropsychiatrist, for example, has stated that mr reids delusion, that he has been under the control of a government-directed surveillance and influence, impels, invades, and guides his daily activities as well as decision-making processes. mr reids delusional beliefs substantially preclude him from making a rational choice among his legal options. the lawyer who was assigned the case before paul reid dropped his appeals also signed an affidavit in may 2006 stating that reids mental illness substantially affects his capacity to make knowing, intelligent, and voluntary decisions about his legal situation. i have known paul reid for over twenty months and during that entire time, his delusional beliefs have been persistent and have pervaded his thinking about all aspects of his life. his delusional beliefs have caused him to either refuse to discuss legal issues with me, as he believes it is futile, or to discuss only the specific delusional beliefs he holds about his trial attorneys, the trial judges, the jurors, witnesses, courtroom personnel, state and federal appellate courts, the media, the governor, the president, congress, department of correction personnel  literally everyone. background information at least 119 of the 1,024 men and women executed in the usa since judicial killing resumed in 1977 went to their deaths after dropping their appeals. many of these so-called volunteers had histories of mental illness. a condemned prisoner who drops his appeals has to be competent to do so, but the protections in such cases have proved minimal. if a condemned inmate is found incompetent to waive his or her appeals, someone found to have legal standing as a next friend may pursue litigation on their behalf. in 2002, in atkins v. virginia , the supreme court prohibited the death penalty for people with mental retardation. the court reasoned that the impairments of defendants with mental retardation diminish their personal culpability and their ability to understand consequences, rendering the death penalty unjustifiable on grounds of retribution or deterrence. amnesty international believes that there is a profound inconsistency in exempting people with mental retardation from the death penalty while those with serious mental illness remain exposed to it. the same rationale of diminished culpability, greater vulnerability and limited capacity applies to defendants afflicted with severe mental illness. tennessee has executed one person since 1977  robert coe in 2000. he had

usa transferred two tunisian nationals, abdellah ben omar al hajji and lutfi ben swei lagha, from guantnamo bay, cuba, to the custody of the tunisian government. amnesty international fears that they are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment in tunisia. the us department of defense publicly announced the transfers of the two tunisian nationals to tunisia, and also of four yemeni nationals to yemen, on 19 june. amnesty international has no further information on lutfi ben swei lagha, who had no legal representation while he was held in guantnamo. abdellah al hajjis us lawyer, who was not informed of the transfer until 19 june, had only been able to meet with his client once during his detention in guantnamo. during that meeting, abdellah al hajji had expressed his fear of being forcibly returned to tunisia. abdellah al hajji left tunisia in 1989 and settled in pakistan, after briefly returning to tunisia to collect his family (he married in 1984 and has eight children). in 1991 or 1992, he was reportedly convicted in absentiafor his alleged association with the non-violent islamist organization ennahdha, in military trials which were grossly unfair, and sentenced to 23 years in prison. he was arrested at his home in lahore, pakistan in early 2002. he was handed over to us custody by pakistani agents, allegedly for a payment. after the us-led military intervention in afghanistan in october 2001, us agents paid rewards of up to us$5,000 for every alleged ""terrorist"" handed over to them, a practice that encouraged arbitrary detentions in pakistan and afghanistan. in august 2002, abdellah ben omar al hajji became one of hundreds of people sent to guantnamo bay. tunisian agents reportedly visited abdellah al hajji in guantnamo, and told him that they had nothing

detainee is transferred that it will not torture the individual being transferred."" amnesty international opposes reliance on diplomatic assurances as a basis for sending individuals to countries where they would otherwise be considered at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. diplomatic assurances under these circumstances are unreliable and unenforceable, yet the usa has used such assurances in this and other cases. the committee against torture stressed to the usa that assurances should not be relied upon where the state was responsible for systematic violations of the convention against torture. the human rights committee emphasized that the more systematic the practice of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the less likely it will be that a real risk of such treatment can be avoided by such assurances, however stringent any agreed follow-up procedures may be. in its most recent report on human rights in other countries, issued in march 2007, the us state departments entry on tunisia stated that members of the security forces tortured and physically abused prisoners and detainees. security forces arbitrarily arrested and

april 2004 usa (missouri)   raymond e. wood raymond wood (m), white, aged 40, is facing the possibility of the death penalty in missouri. he has a history of serious mental illness and there is compelling evidence that he was psychotic at the time of the crime with which he has been charged. the united nations commission on human rights has repeatedly called on countries not to resort to the death penalty against anyone suffering from a mental disorder. a trial date has not yet been set. on 14 february 2000, the police were called to a shooting in a rural home outside warrensburg in johnson county in mid-western missouri. the caller, raymond woods mother, said that her son had told her that he had shot his family. she also told the police that her son was mentally ill and was on medication. the police went to the house and found that tina wood and her six young children (aged from 18 months to 10 years) had been shot. the two youngest children were wounded, but alive. the four other children, and their mother, were dead. raymond wood was arrested at the scene. on the evening of the same day, raymond wood was questioned at the police station by two plainclothes police officers, one of whom was a close personal friend of wood and a lay minister at his church. he led the interrogation, adopting the style he used when ministering to a member of his congregation. raymond wood explained that he had shot his wife, and then, realizing that his children would suffer from the loss of their mother, shot each child. he said that he then shot himself, and showed the officers abrasions and gunpowder burns on his forehead. during his interview, raymond wood referred to the  ;turmoil he had been experiencing in the days leading to the shootings, and he talked of the snares in his head and of too many ensnaring thoughts. the interrogation was terminated abruptly when raymond woods mental health took a turn for the worse. he was placed on suicide watch and was placed in a restraint chair after he became uncontrollable. he was subsequently taken to hospital in restraints, and was assessed as suffering from a major psychosis, severe depression, and a major affective disturbance. he was involuntarily committed to a state mental hospital where he has remained continuously since, that is for the past four years. in february 2003, raymond woods lawyer filed a motion in the trial court seeking to suppress his confession, arguing that it had not been given voluntarily because he was mentally ill and because the authorities had used coercive conduct in selecting an interrogator who was a friend and minister to the prisoner. at a hearing, the minister/officer testified that he had had concerns at the time of the interrogation that raymond wood was out of touch with reality, and he described the defendant as being gravely disabled at that time. members of raymond woods family testified that he had been exhibiting signs of his mental illness in the days before the shootings. for example, he and his wife had gone to a mental health facility on 11 february 2000, at which time he was described as catatonic, psychotic and suffering from delusional thoughts. hospitalization was recommended, but he and tina wood opted for him to return home and start the prescribed medication, an antipsychotic and an antidepressant, at home. from 11 to 14 february, his condition continued to deteriorate, and he complained of hearing voices and of being possessed by the devil. a psychiatrist for the defence testified that she believed that raymond woods mental illness meant that he could not have made a voluntary waiver of his rights (such as his right to have a lawyer present or to remain silent). a psychiatrist for the state, while concluding that wood was able to knowingly make such a waiver, acknowledged the evidence that the defendant was actively psychotic in the days immediately preceding the shooting and at the time of the interrogation, and that on the morning of the shooting, wood would have qualified for involuntary commitment to a mental hospital. following the hearing, the judge found that the confession had been involuntary. she found that the police had known at the time of the interrogation that raymond wood was mentally ill and that he had a history of serious mental illness and had been previously committed to psychiatric care. the authorities also knew that wood was deeply religious and would likely respond to his minister during the interrogation. the judge stated:  certain interrogation techniquesare so offensive to a civilized system of justice that they must be condemned. such interrogation techniques, applied to the unique characteristics of the defendant, exist in this case. the state appealed the trial judges suppression of the confession, but the missouri court of appeals upheld the decision in march 2004. raymond wood was first admitted to a psychiatric facility in 1985 and has been admitted on numerous occasions since. he has been diagnosed with severe mental illness since 1985 and is currently diagnosed as suffering from schizoaffective disorder. according to nami, a us grassroots organization (formerly the national alliance for the mentally ill), schizoaffective disorder is  characterized by a combination of symptoms of schizophrenia and an affective (mood) disorder. to diagnose schizoaffective disorder, a person needs to have primary symptoms of schizophrenia (such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior) along with a period of time when he or she also has symptoms of major depression or a manic episode. nami opposes the use of the death penalty against anyone suffering from such a serious mental illness. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. today, 117 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast to this, more than 900 prisoners have been put to death in the usa since executions resumed in 1977. among them have been prisoners who were mentally ill at the time of the crime and/or execution. the un commission on human rights, in resolutions passed each year since 1999, has called on all countries not to impose the death penalty on anyone suffering from a mental disorder, or to execute any such person. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as

in gel, san miguel ixtahuacn municipality, san marcos department, in south-western guatemala. she has also spoken out to defend her communitys right to water amidst fears that mining operations have affected the local water supply. on 7 july, she was shot at close range in her own home. at around 7 pm, two unknown men entered her home asking for lodging for the night. a relative of deodora hernndez replied that they couldnt stay, but sold them two cups of coffee. when deodora hernndez entered the room with the coffee, one of the men shot her in the right eye. both men then ran off.

activist campaigning against the alleged impacts of the mining on local people's human rights, received a number of threatening text messages, saying that she shouldnt defend human rights and that she would be killed. during the special rapporteur's visit, carmen meja spoke in a public meeting with him about the human rights that the mine is allegedly violating. on 18 june, carmen meja received a further threatening text message. the 18 indigenous mayan communities in the municipalities of san miguel ixtahuacn and sipacapa, san marcos department, should already be under protection, because on 20 may 2010, the inter-american commission on human rights (iachr) granted them precautionary protective measures. the iachr requested that the guatemalan government take measures to safeguard their lives and safety and suspend operation of the marlin mine, owned by montana exploradora de guatemala, s.a., a wholly-owned subsidiary of goldcorp. background information the request for precautionary measures from the inter-american commission on human rights (iachr) on 20 may 2010 asked that the guatemalan government suspend operation of the marlin mine, owned by montana exploradora de guatemala,

with indigenous peoples in guatemala, in particular with relation to extractive industries, and with a special focus on the situation of indigenous peoples living near to the mining operations in san miguel ixtahuacn and sipacapa. at the end of his visit, the special rapporteur stated that he had received allegations that on many occasions the guatemalan government had granted licenses for the exploitation of natural resources in indigenous territories without the necessary consultations with local indigenous peoples. he added that he had received testimonies alleging that there had been harassment and attacks against community leaders, and that the testimonies imply that the security forces and private companies could be behind such incidents. on 23 june, the guatemalan government announced that they would comply with the iachr request to suspend the mining companys operations, but added the next day that this would take some time as legal and administrative processes would have to be followed. the mining companys operations continue to date. the defense of human rights is a legitimate activity, fundamental for the advancement of human rights for all. the authorities in

imminent execution usa (alabama)   eddie duval powell (m), aged 41 eddie duval powell, a 41-year-old african american man, is scheduled to be executed in the us state of alabama on 16 june. he was sentenced to death in 1998 for a murder in 1995. his lawyers claim that he has a mental disability that would render his execution unconstitutional. mattie wesson, a 70-year-old white woman, was raped and shot dead in her home near tuscaloosa, alabama, in the early hours of 25 march 1995. eddie powell, who lived across the street from the victim, was brought to trial in 1997. after the jury was unable to decide on whether to recommend life imprisonment or death, and after the judge agreed that there had been prosecutorial misconduct at the guilt phase, a full new trial was held in june 1998. eddie powell was again convicted, and this time the jury of 11 whites and one african american voted by 11 to one to recommend the death penalty. the jury heard some mitigating evidence at the trial, including that eddie powell had been assessed as mildly retarded at around the age of 10 and placed in special education classes. four years after the trial, the us supreme court ruled, in atkins v. virginia, that the execution of people who had mental retardation violated the us constitution. the court did not define mental retardation, but pointed to definitions used by professional bodies. under such definitions, it is a disability, manifested before the age of 18, characterized by significantly sub-average intellectual functioning (generally indicated by an iq of less than 70) accompanied by limitations in two or more adaptive skill areas such as communication, self-care, work, and functioning in the community. the court left it to individual states to develop appropriate ways to comply with the ruling. after the supreme courts ruling, eddie powells appeal lawyers raised an atkins claim, but were unsuccessful. none of the state or federal court held an evidentiary hearing on the issue before ruling against powell. eddie powell has recently been assessed by a clinical psychologist. dr harvey switzky, who has concluded that when one puts all the evidence together, eddie presents as a person with significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning in the mild range of mental retardation. eddie was considered as functioning in the mentally retarded range by his family and the educational system during the developmental period. he has also pointed to considerable evidence that eddies mental retardation was exacerbated by a chaotic, violent, dysfunctional family social environment, brain injury and drug abuse. eddie powells lawyers have appealed to the alabama supreme court to order an evidentiary hearing, and are also seeking executive clemency, including on the grounds that the jury did not hear all available mitigating evidence (see overleaf). background information when the state trial-level court denied eddie powells atkins claim in 2004, the judge found that the claim was refuted by the record and therefore could be dismissed without an evidentiary hearing. among other things, the judge pointed to the trial testimony of dr marianne rosenzweig, a psychologist who had been retained as an expert witness by eddie powells trial lawyers. the reviewing judge noted that at the trial dr rosenzweig said that she had found no evidence to support the mental retardation assessment given to eddie powell at school, and stated that in her opinion he might simply have been suffering depression. in 2007, dr rosenzweig signed a sworn statement in which she stated that she had been retained by the trial lawyers only six weeks before the trial and had considered that this would not be enough time to adequately assist in mr powells defense. in addition, she said that the trial lawyers had never asked her to conduct any psychological testing of the defendant or to confirm mr powells retardation with an iq test or any other testing instrument. as a result, she said, she was unable to diagnose mr powell with mental retardation and instead had attributed his early placement in special education to depression. she said that she had been unaware at that time that eddie powell had spent his entire education career in the lake county, illinois school system in special education classes. if she had known then the information that she had been provided by eddie powells appeal lawyers, i would have insisted that an iq test by performed in mr powells case, and her review of these materials had led her to conclude that during his childhood, mr powell exhibited many characteristics typical of people with mental retardation: including for example, low self-esteem, lack of self-direction, long-term problems with functional academics, feelings of alienation, and problems with concrete thinking. in his recent evaluation of eddie powells intellectual functioning, dr switzky pointed to relevant evidence from the condemned mans birth and childhood. his birth had been a difficult one that had resulted in a lack of oxygen to his brain, and during his pregnancy his mother had abused amphetamine and inhalants such as gasoline and insecticides. eddie powell had been raised in illinois in a high crime neighborhood in dire poverty, and had been emotionally and actually abandoned by his parents which led to eddies frequent depressions, and acts of self-hurt and frequent suicide attempts. in addition, dr switzky continued, eddie suffered multiple head injuries as a child and had been assessed as having sustained damage to the frontal and orbital lobes of his brain. the appeal lawyers have also presented mitigating evidence on appeal that was not presented to the jury, including the young eddie powells witnessing of violence involving his parents, the poverty in which he grew up (including when they lived in subsidized housing in illinois, their apartment was so infested with roaches, rates and bats that the building was eventually condemned), his mothers struggle with mental illness, his fathers alcoholism, and the boys suicide attempts, and his subjection to sexual assaults when held in an adult prison before he was 18. in a ruling by the us district court in 2008 upholding eddie powells death sentence, the federal judge noted that familial violence, severe poverty, alcoholism were not a part of the background evidence presented to the jury, but ruled the outcome of the trial would not have been different even if the jury had heard such evidence. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of the crime, the offender, or the method of execution. there have been 1,254 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977. alabama accounts for 52 of these executions, and has carried out three of the 20 executions in the usa so far this year. faced with a national shortage of sodium thiopental, one of the drugs until now used by most states in their three-drug lethal injection protocols, a number have moved to amend their procedures to allow for an alternative barbiturate as the first of the three drugs, or to one-drug protocols using a barbiturate alone. the substitute to sodium thiopental already selected and used by a number of states already is pentobarbital. in april, alabama announced that it had amended its three-drug protocol to allow for the use of pentobarbital, and the state carried out its first such execution on 19 may. the denmark-based manufacturer of pentobarbital has condemned the use of the drug for executions and has promised that it would continue to urge states in the us to refrain from using pentobarbital for the execution of prisoners as it contradicts everything we stand for as a company. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - acknowledge the seriousness of the crime of which eddie powell was convicted and explaining that you are not seeking to downplay the seriousness of the crime or the suffering caused; - oppose the execution of eddie powell; - express concern that no court has ever held an evidentiary hearing into the claim that eddie powell has mental retardation, and that the jury did not hear all available mitigating evidence about his background; - note that the power of

journalist sami yousufzai and his pakistani driver, mohammad salim who ""disappeared"" on 21 april. their families have been unable to establish their whereabouts and fear they may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. sami yousufzai, a regular contributor to the us magazine newsweek , and his driver mohammad salim were arrested near the town of bannu, along with american journalist eliza griswold. as foreign journalists they were barred from entering tribal areas without specific permission. eliza griswold, who works for the new yorker magazine, had apparently disguised herself as an afghan woman wearing the traditional burqa. they were arrested at a checkpoint, when eliza griswold was unable to answer a question in the local language, pashtu by what pakistani media describe as personnel of secret agencies. these were probably members of the federal investigation unit (fiu) which is under military command. eliza griswold was reportedly sent to the capital islamabad and later left the country. it is not known in whose custody sami yousufzai and mohammad salim are currently being held as the authorities have denied holding them. they have not been brought before a court as is required by law, and may be held in military custody. media reports speculate that the two men may initially have been taken to the town of kohat, before being taken into military custody in the city ofpeshawar. unnamed government officials have been quoted in the pakistani media as saying that the two men were transferred about a week ago to a detention centre in the town of miran shah, north waziristan, which is a federally administered tribal area. detainees in the tribal areas can be tried under the frontier crimes regulation of 1901 which falls considerably short of international standards for fair trial. local observers have expressed their concern about the legality of such transfers. they have also expressed their more general apprehension that following pakistans decision to support the united states of america in the war on terror, pakistani legal safeguards are widely ignored when there are security concerns. a lawyer in peshawar filed a habeas corpus petition on 13 may in the peshawar high court on behalf of sami yousufzai's mother, naming the central government, the north west frontier province (nwfp) government and the corps commander as respondents. the high court has issued notice to all respondents and it is expected that upon receiving a reply, the high court will decide next week whether to admit the petition and proceed with it. local observers have told amnesty international that they fear that it will be very difficult to find out where the two men are being held if they have been transferred to the tribal areas. this is because they will be outside the jurisdiction of the peshawar high court and habeas corpus does not apply in tribal areas. background information military and paramilitary forces searching for those associated with al-qa ;ida and the taleban in tribal areas have recently threatened and harassed journalists as well as taken away or destroyed their equipment. the journalists were intimidated as they attempted to cover the security operation in the areas. in a similar case to that of sami yousufzai and mohammad salim, journalist khawar medhi rizvi, disappeared after being arrested on 16 december 2003 in karachi after working with two french journalists near the afghan border. the french journalists were subsequently charged under the foreigners act with violating visa regulations as they had not obtained clearance to visit balochistan province. they were released on bail on 24 december 2003 and received a suspended sentence of six months' imprisonment and a fine on 10 january 2004. two days later at their appeal hearing, the sindh high court upheld the sentence but remitted their jail term to the time already served, whilst doubling their fine. they were released and left the country forthwith. after the authorities had consistently denied holding khawar medhi rizvi, he was brought before a court in the city of quetta on 26 january 2004. he had spent 35 days in incommunicado detention, and was charged with sedition and criminal conspiracy. on 29 march, khawar medhi rizvi was released on bail and his case is due to be heard again shortly (see ua 13/04, asa 33/001/2004, 13 january 2004). amnesty international believes that the ""disappearance"" of sami yousufzai and mohammad salim violates a number of human rights guaranteed in the constitution of pakistan and international human rights standards. the constitution of pakistan states in article 9: no person shall be deprived of life and liberty, save in accordance with law. it lays down in article 10 that every detainee has the right to be informed of the charges against them, to consult and be defended by a lawyer of his choice and be brought before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest. none of these requirements have been fulfilled in the case of sami yousufzai and mohammad salim. by possibly transferring the two detainees to areas outside the jurisdiction of the provincial high courts, the authorities have also denied them the right to have the lawfulness of their detention examined by a high court. under article 199 of the constitution of pakistan, provincial high courts have the power to direct that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the court be brought before it so that the court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner. the tribal areas are outside the jurisdiction of any of the countrys high courts. there are also concerns for their safety given the widespread use of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in detention in pakistan. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing concern at the disappearance"" of sami yousufzai and mohammad salim

execution usa (alabama)       holly wood (m), aged 50 holly wood, a 50-year-old african american man who has significant mental impairments, is due to be executed in alabama on 9 september. four federal judges on three courts have concluded that he was denied adequate legal representation at the sentencing stage of his 1994 trial. holly woods former girlfriend, ruby lois gosha, the mother of their son, was shot in her home on 1 september 1993. a jury convicted holly wood of her murder on 21 october 1994. at the sentencing hearing, holly wood was represented by a lawyer who had been admitted to the bar five months earlier, had no trial or criminal law experience, and had never worked on a capital case before. alabama law required that lawyers appointed to capital cases had at least five years experience in criminal law. the novice lawyer was appointed to assist the two senior lawyers on the case, but they delegated the penalty phase to him and effectively abandoned him. the presentation of mitigating evidence at the sentencing was minimal. in particular, there was no evidence at all presented about holly woods mental ability despite the lawyers being in possession of an expert report indicating that wood operated, at most, in the borderline range of intellectual functioning. because of the novice lawyers inadequate investigation, the fact that as a child holly wood had been in special education classes for children with low iq scores was not investigated or presented to the jury. the us supreme court has recognized that impaired intellectual functioning is inherently mitigating (2004) and has said that evidence that a capital defendant is borderline mentally retarded, might well influence[e] the jurys appraisal of his moral culpability (2000). by a vote of 10-2, the jury voted to recommend the death penalty. another vote against death would have resulted in a life sentence. the vote was split along racial lines, with the two black jurors voting for life imprisonment and the 10 whites voting for execution. blacks had been disproportionately removed by the prosecution during jury selection. the judge accepted the jury recommendation and sentenced holly wood to death on 9 december 1994, finding that there were no mitigating circumstances. the alabama courts upheld the death sentence. however, in 2006 senior us district court judge harold albritton ruled that holly wood had been denied his right to effective assistance of counsel at the sentencing, and ordered that he be resentenced to life in prison, or given a new sentencing hearing. in 2008, the court of appeals for the 11th circuit overturned the ruling, citing the highly deferential standards to be given to state court decisions by the federal judiciary. one of the three judges dissented, citing the egregious failures and sheer neglect of the trial lawyers. in 2010, the us supreme court upheld the 10th circuit decision. two justices dissented, arguing that the failure of the trial lawyers to investigate woods mental disability was the product of inattention and neglect. background information at the sentencing phase of holly woods trial, the defense case consisted of testimony from his father and two of his sisters. the novice lawyer met with them for the first time at the courthouse during the guilt phase of the trial (the sentencing phase began a day after the guilt phase ended). according to us district court judge albritton, the mitigation testimony amounted to little more than a plea for juror sympathy. substantial mitigating evidence about holly woods background of poverty and deprivation and his upbringing in an environment dominated by alcohol was not presented. neither was evidence of whippings to which he was subjected by his mother, and after she died when he was about 10 years old, the regular severe beatings with an extension cord he received at the hands of his adult stepsister who became his caregiver. however, it was the utter failure of the defense counsel to present any evidence of his mental impairment that has divided the federal courts on his case. in 2002, the us supreme court ruled, in atkins v. virginia, that the execution of offenders with mental retardation was prohibited. the atkins ruling pointed to professional definitions of such disability, but left it to the individual states to take appropriate steps to enforce the ban. in alabama, in the absence of a legislative response to the atkins ruling, the state court of criminal appeals said in 2006 that for a defendant to be considered to have mental retardation, he or she must have significantly sub-average intellectual functioning (an iq of 70 or below), and significant or substantial deficits in adaptive behavior (and these problems must have manifested themselves before the individual was 18 years old). lawyers for holly wood raised an atkins claim, but after an evidentiary hearing in 2003, a state court decided that he did not have mental retardation and upheld his death sentence. in their appeal to the federal district court, holly woods lawyers maintained that it was uncontested that his iq was below 70 (during post-conviction proceedings, psychologists had assessed his iq at 64 and 59), that he had significant limitations in one area of adaptive functioning, namely functional academic skills (e.g. reading), and that these deficits had manifested before he was 18 years old. the case therefore turned on whether he had adaptive deficits in more than one area. the state argued successfully during the appeals process that he does not. the fact that holly woods death sentence has been upheld has relied on federal judicial deference to state court decisions. in this case, the state courts found that the defense counsel had made a strategic choice not to present the mental impairment evidence. in his 2006 decision, judge albritton wrote that he had found nothing in the record to even remotely support a finding that counsel made a strategic decision not to let the jury at the penalty phase know about woods mental condition. in overturning this decision, the two 11th circuit judges emphasized that their role under federal law was not to determine anew whether the defense lawyers were ineffective or whether wood was prejudiced by their ineffectiveness, but whether under the general framework of substantial deference for reviewing state court rulings, the latter had been unreasonable. they ruled that they had not. in the 2010 us supreme court decision, the two dissenting justices argued that the only reasonable factual conclusion to be drawn from the record was that the defense lawyers failure to present the evidence was the result of inattention and neglect, which is the antithesis of a strategic choice. indeed, they said, the decision not to carry out any investigation into woods mental disability, even though the lawyers were in possession of an expert report that indicated his possible mental retardation, was so obviously unreasonable that the decision itself is highly persuasive evidence that counsel did not have any strategy in mind when they did so. amnesty international unconditionally opposes the death penalty. the usa has carried out 1,224 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977. alabama accounts for 47 of these executions. there have been 36 executions in the usa this year, three of them in alabama. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the killing of ruby lois gosha; - expressing concern that holly wood was represented at his sentencing by a novice lawyer with no experience, and that the jury was presented no evidence of holly woods significant mental

patriotic front (zanu-pf) have instigated and perpetrated the violence in the majority of incidents. according to reports, armed zanu-pf supporters have made house- to-house searches for residents believed to be mdc supporters. in mid-june, makundwei motsi muzavazi of the musana communal lands area was assaulted by zanu-pf supporters armed with chains and sticks, because they believed he was an mdc supporter. he required hospital treatment in harare for injuries to his head. zanu- pf supporters have also assaulted a number of mdc campaigning officials, including felix kunaka, bindura district chairman for the mdc, kifas madzongere, bindura district mdc youth chair, tom walter, the mdc district secretary, and peter mabika, deputy district chairman. they and other activists have been forced to flee into hiding, out of fear for their own safety and that of their families. the police are failing to take adequate steps to arrest perpetrators and prevent incidents of violence and intimidation, and appear in some cases to have arrested opposition party activists in order to prevent them from campaigning. in addition, road blocks manned jointly by police, security police and zanu-pf supporters are reportedly used to stop and search travellers for evidence of support for the mdc, thus hampering freedom of movement, for journalists, monitors, opposition activists and others involved in activities relating to the by-election. on 11 july reason chikono and five other mdc youth activists were abducted from the musana area and assaulted by a group of zanu- pf supporters. after the group passed a police post, police officers intervened. although the mdc youths were visibly injured, the police took no action against the zanu-pf supporters holding them captive. on the contrary, they took reason chikono and the five other mdc youths into custody for questioning. they were brought before bindura magistrate's court on 13 july on suspicion of involvement in clashes with zanu-pf supporters. they were released on bail. in some cases, mdc youth arrested by the police have alleged that they were assaulted at the time of arrest, including several members of a group of 19 mdc youth supporters arrested while putting up campaign posters. in a separate case, about 30 mdc youth activists were allegedly dropped by police some 150 km from bindura and told to 'campaign from here'. scores of people have reportedly fled the bindura area. those who have fled  include teachers, who are being particularly targeted as suspected mdc supporters, and other civil servants. victims who have fled often do not wish to be named, out of fear of being marked as mdc supporters. amnesty international is concerned at the apparent impunity for perpetrators of politically-motivated attacks. the organization fears that human rights violations may continue in bindura after the by- election, regardless of its outcome, and in connection with pending by-elections and the presidential elections due in early 2002. this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. background information the by-election in bindura follows the death of border gezi, who died in a car accident on 28 april. border gezi won the bindura seat for zanu-pf in the june 2000 national elections, and was minister of youth development, gender and employment creation. the zanu- pf candidate for the by-election is elliot manyika, the governor of mashonaland central province. the bindura area suffered serious political violence in the run-up to the june 2000 elections. on 1 may 2000, matthew pfebve, the brother of elliot pfebve, the mdc candidate at the time and in the current by-election, was abducted from the family's home village in nyakatondo and killed, allegedly by armed zanu-pf supporters. elliot pfebve's elderly father was severely injured at the same time. to date the perpetrators have not been brought to justice. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - urging the authorities to protect all persons in bindura district from human rights violations, regardless of their real or perceived political affiliation; - urging the authorities to ensure freedom of movement in the area for journalists, human rights monitors and observers at all times; -

(ua 292/05, eur 59/006/2005, 18 november 2005). the subsequent publicity was clearly a great embarrassment to the general prosecutors office, and in a letter to amnesty international on 9 march the general prosecutors office stated that the version of events given in the urgent action does not correspond to the reality, generates image crisis for our state. a second urgent action was issued when sergei gurgurov was detained again on 18 april 2006. he was released on 12 may 2006. no action has been taken against the police officers concerned. roman zadoinovs client, vitalii kolibaba, was reportedly tortured at buiucani district police station in chisinau on 25 april 2006. vitalii kolibaba was allegedly hung from a crowbar and beaten, and after being taken back to his cell attempted to commit suicide by slitting his wrists. following the urgent action he was released on bail on 15 may. the general prosecutors office informed the lawyer at the end of may 2006 that a criminal case would not be started against the police officers concerned. in the letter to the bar association, the general prosecutors office refers to the urgent actions that were issued by amnesty international on the two cases and claims that there was no evidence of torture in either case. it goes on to say: in these circumstances the irresponsible and unfounded oppositional behavior of the lawyers anna ursachi and roman zadoinov is incomprehensible and questionablethe lawyers have created a bad image for the country internationally using improper methods to defend the interests of their clients. the general prosecutors office asks the bar association to ensure that they use all possible means at their disposal to prevent further damage to the interests of the state. background information in april 2006 the european court of human rights ruled in the case of corsacov v. moldova that moldova had violated article 3 of the european convention because the applicant had been ill-treated by police officers. the court also decided that the general prosecutors office had failed to conduct an effective investigation and by refusing to open a case against the police officers concerned deprived the applicant of an effective remedy against the ill-treatment he had suffered. amnesty international is concerned that the letter to the bar association of moldova is a deliberate attempt to intimidate ana ursachi and roman zadoinov, and to prevent lawyers in moldova from making public information about human rights violations. it is a violation of the right to freedom of expression, and if the lawyers were to be imprisoned for this offence amnesty international would consider them prisoners of conscience. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - urging the authorities not to instigate criminal proceedings against ana ursachi and roman zadoinov for the legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of expression; - calling for an immediate end to all attempts to intimidate and harass lawyers for the legitimate exercise of their professional duties; - reminding the authorities that moldova has ratified the international covenant on civil and political rights, article 19 of which states that the right to freedom of expression includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers; - reminding the authorities of the un declaration on the right and responsibility of individuals, groups and organs of society to promote and protect universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, article 5 of which states that everyone has the right to communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations nationally and internationally. appeals to: prosecutor general of the republic of moldova: valeriu balaban mitropolitul banulescu-bodoni str. 26 md-2005 chisinau republic of moldova","","",1,FALSE

they have had no access to lawyers since their arrest in malawi on 22 june. their transfer out of malawi violated national law and circumvented any formal human rights protections. the five were arrested in blantyre, malawi, on suspicion of being members of al-qaida . according to information received by amnesty international, the arrests were carried out by members of malawis national intelligence bureau together with us agents, reported to be members of the central intelligence agency (cia). the five men were initially held at an undisclosed location in malawi. according to malawi law, suspects should be brought to court within 48 hours of their arrest, or released on bail. after defense lawyers intervened on the five mens behalf, the high court of blantyre ordered the detainees to be brought before it within 48 hours. the 48 hours expired at 19.30 local time on 24 june, by which time the men had not appeared before the court. it has transpired that earlier on 24 june, the five men had been flown out of malawi on board a plane chartered by the usa. they are now being held at an undisclosed location in us custody for interrogation. background information since the attacks in the usa on 11 september 2001, more than 3,000 alleged members or associates of al-qaida have been detained in over 100 countries, according to the us government. it is not known how many remain in custody, or the whereabouts of all of them. more than 650 foreign nationals are held without charge or trial in the custody of the us department of defence in guantnamo bay in cuba. held in the us naval base there, they have had no access to any court, to legal counsel, or to their relatives. many have been so held for more than a year. although many of the detainees were taken into custody in the context of the international armed conflict in afghanistan, some were not. they include, for example, six algerian nationals unlawfully seized by the usa in bosnia-herzegovina in january 2002. the usa is planning to bring selected detainees to trial before executive military commissions, in proceedings which would violate international fair trial standards, for example by not providing the right of appeal to any court. the commissions will have the power to hand down death sentences. other detainees are held in the us air base in bagram in afghanistan. allegations of torture and ill-treatment at the hands of cia interrogators have emerged from the base. it is alleged that so-called stress and duress techniques have been used against detainees under interrogation  including forced prolonged standing or kneeling, hooding, blindfolding, being kept in painful or awkward positions, sleep deprivation, and 24-hour lighting. other detainees have been held incommunicado by us agents at other undisclosed locations outside the usa. it is also alleged that detainees have been transferred by the usa to third countries, including morocco, jordan and egypt. the us government has given assurances that if the war on terrorists of global reach requires transfers of detained enemy combatants to other countries for continued detention on our behalf, us government instructions are to seek and obtain appropriate assurances that such enemy combatants are not tortured. the washington post , however, has reported that, according to an official directly involved in rendering detainees to other countries: we dont kick the [expletive] out of them. we send them to other countries so they can kick the [expletive] out of them. article 3 of the convention against torture prohibits the transfer of anyone to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture. the practice of incommunicado detention has been consistently condemned by human rights bodies as facilitating conditions under which torture and other abuses may take place. the human rights committee, the expert body established by the international covenant on civil and political rights to oversee implementation of that treaty, in its authoritative interpretation of article 7 (no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment) has stated: to guarantee the effective protection of detained persons, provisions should be made for detainees to be held in places officially recognized as places of detention and for their names and places of detention, as well as for the names of persons responsible for their detention, to be kept in registers readily available and accessible to those concerned, including relatives and friends. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - acknowledging the duty of governments to protect public safety and to investigate crime, and recognizing that governments will need to cooperate to this end where the threats or crimes in question cross national boundaries; - stressing, however, that human rights must be at the centre of the search for justice and security; - expressing concern that the transfer of ibrahim habaci, arif ulusam, faha al bahli, mahmud sardar issa and khalifa abdi hassan out of malawi violated malawi law, in failing to comply with the blantyre high courts order, and bypassed any formal human rights protections; - urging that the whereabouts of the five men be made public and seeking assurances that they will be treated humanely in full accordance with international law and standards; - urging that they be promptly brought before a court of law to be able to challenge the lawfulness of their detention; - urging that they be charged with recognizably criminal offences, and brought to trial within a reasonable time in accordance with

191/06  death penalty / legal concern usa (ohio)  rocky barton (m), white, aged 49 rocky barton is scheduled to be executed in ohio on 12 july 2006. he was sentenced to death for the murder of his wife, kimbirli barton. he has given up his appeals against his conviction and sentence. rocky barton shot and killed kimbirli barton on 16 january 2003. he then shot himself in the head with his shotgun, but survived. at his trial for the murder, his defense was that the killing had not been premeditated. a jury rejected this and the trial went into its sentencing phase. rocky barton refused to have any mitigating evidence presented to the jury. instead, he made the following statement to the jury: at this time my attorneys have advised me to beg for my life. i cant do that. i strongly believe in the death penalty. and for the ruthless, cold-blooded act that i committed, if i was sitting over there, id hold out for the death penaltylife in prison would be a burden to all the citizens of ohio. it would be at their cost. i wouldnt have nothing to worry about. id get fed every day, have a roof over my head, free medical, you people pay for it, id have a stress-free life. thats not much of a punishment. punishment would be to wake up every day and have a date with death. thats the only punishment for this crime. thats all ive got to say. in its 2006 affirmation of the death sentence on mandatory appeal, the ohio supreme court rejected the argument that the trial judge should have inquired whether rocky barton was mentally competent to waive his right to present any mitigating evidence. it reached this conclusion by deciding that bartons statement to the jury asking for the death penalty was mitigating evidence. two of the justices dissented. justice pfeifer wrote: our countrys most creative writers of fiction would be hard-pressed to spin bartons statement as evidence offered in mitigation. yet a majority of this court unquestioningly accepts that it was. he also wrote: i do not believe that the facts of this case justify imposing a sentence of death. the murder that barton committed was heinous, and his guilt is undeniable, but bartons crime is not deathworthy this case involves a hot-blooded domestic killing. chief justice moyer wrote: it is difficult to imagine more compelling indicia of incompetence than a defendant asking to be executed, and accused the majority of applying inverse logic to interpret the statement as mitigating. he added: i do not know whether barton was competent to waive the presentation of mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of the trial. i do not know whether he understood the ramifications of his statements to the jury suggesting that he deserved the death penalty. on the record before us, no one can be certain of bartons competence when he urged the jury to sentence him to death. in a recent interviechief justice moyer wrote: it is difficult to imagine more compelling indicia of incompetence than a defendant asking to be executed, and accused the majority of applying inverse logic to interpret the statement as mitigating. he added: i do not know whether barton was competent to waive the presentation of mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of the trial. i do not know whether he understood the ramifications of his statements to the jury suggesting that he deserved the death penalty. on the record before us, no one can be certain of bartons competence when he urged the jury to sentence him to death. in a recent interview, in contrast to his assertion to the jury that it was a ruthless, cold-blooded murder, rocky barton recalled that the shooting was done on the spur of the moment, and was not planned, calculated, designed. he said that he had planned to kill himself in front of kimbirli, but had then turned the gun on her: i dont know why i did. cant tell you what was going through my mind at the time. rocky barton is reported to have been diagnosed on death row as suffering from a major depressive illness and schizo-affective disorder, for which he has received medication. on 5 july 2006, a judge found him competent to waive his appeals, despite refusing to allow a psychiatric evaluation to determine competence. background information in 1972, the us supreme court overturned the usas capital laws after finding that the death penalty was being applied in an arbitrary manner (furman v. georgia). four years later, in gregg v. georgia, the court approved new laws passed by state legislatures. executions resumed in january 1977 after almost a decade without them. there have been some 500,000 murders in the usa since 1977. in the same period about 7,000 people have been sentenced to death, just over 1,000 of whom have been executed and about 3,300 of whom remain on death row. the capital justice system, which attempts to select the worst of the worst crimes and offenders for execution, is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. as the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions concluded in 1998, race, ethnic origin and economic status appear to be key determinants of who will, and who will not, receive a sentence of death in the usa. in 2000, the findings of a long-term study were released which concluded that us death sentences are persistently and systematically fraught with error that had required judicial remedy from the appeal courts. about one in 10 of the people executed since 1977 have been so-called volunteers, prisoners who had dropped their appeals and consented to execution. any number of factors may lead a prisoner not to pursue appeals against his or her death sentence, including mental disorder, physical illness, remorse, bravado, religious belief, the severity of conditions of confinement, including prolonged isolation and lack of physical contact visits, the bleak alternative of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, pessimism about appeal prospects, a quest for notoriety, or simply a desire to gain a semblance of control over a situation in which the prisoner is otherwise powerless. rational or irrational, a decision taken by someone who is under threat of death at the hands of others cannot be consensual. what is more, it cannot disguise the fact that the state is involved in a premeditated killing  part of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. whether or not prisoners who ask to be executed are deluding themselves about the level of control they have gained over their fate  after all, they are merely assisting their government in what it has set out to do anyway  the state is guilty of a far greater deception. it is peddling its own illusion of control: that, by killing a selection of those it convicts of murder, it can offer a constructive contribution to efforts to defeat violent crime. in reality, the state is taking to refined, calculated heights what it seeks to condemn  the deliberate taking of human life. while such executions are sometimes referred to as a form of state-assisted suicide, ''prisoner-assisted homicide'' would be a more accurate label. for if a death row inmate seeks to commit actual suicide, the state will make every effort to prevent it. the phenomenon of prisoners volunteering for execution contributes to the lottery of the death penalty. to put it another way, given the rate of reversible error found in capital cases, if the approximately 120 volunteers executed since 1977 had pursued their appeals, there is a significant possibility that a number of them would have had their death sentences overturned to prison terms by the appeal courts.

however, these charges can only be brought against a limited range of officials in particular circumstances or places. the prosecuting authorities, who also investigate and prosecute torture offenses, set criteria for taking up cases which further limit the application of these provisions. the broad discretion given to the police by the criminal procedure law (cpl) to detain suspects for long periods before trial increases opportunities for torture and other ill-treatment. during this time detainees access to their families and legal representatives may be limited. under the cpl, the police should inform the family of a detainee about their arrest and place of detention within 24 hours, except where it would hinder the investigation (articles 64 and 71). however, in practice communication with the family is frequently denied until the detainee is brought to trial or sentenced. provisions on access to legal counsel also fall short of international standards. article 96 of the cpl states that a suspect may appoint a lawyer to provide legal advice or to file petitions and complaints on his behalf, after the first session of interrogation by the investigative organ, or from the day when the suspect is subjected to one of the forms of detention or restriction provided by the law. in cases involving state secrets the approval of the police is required before a lawyer is appointed or any meeting between lawyer and client can take place. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   urge the authorities to ensure that alim abdiriyim is not tortured or ill-treated in prison and is provided with all necessary medical treatment including for any injuries sustained in custody;

in total, tens of thousands may be affected. gyselle baret reyes and minoscal de olis oguiza have been unable to obtain a birth certificate for their baby son as the authorities have claimed that minoscals documents are irregular. she complained about this in a discussion program on dominican television on 2 july. emildo bueno oguis has been unable to get a copy of his birth certificate, which he needs so that he can get a passport and travel to the united states to be with his wife, who is a us citizen. he appealed, unsuccessfully, to the central electoral board earlier this year, and has now appealed to the supreme court. his story has been widely covered by the dominican media. on 3 july, a relative from their birthplace, in the northern province of valverde, telephoned minoscal de olis oguiza and emildo bueno oguis, to say that three men claiming to be inspectors from the central electoral board had visited and had left a number for the cousins to call to discuss the issue of their identity documents. they called immediately, gave their contact details in villa altagracia and were told they would be contacted shortly. they heard nothing more. a white toyota camry with blacked-out windows was seen parked outside emildo bueno oguis's house three times on 9 july. gysselle baret reyes noticed it following her on 10 and 11 july. on 12 july, it knocked her off her moped and drove off. she went to the local police station, in the town of villa altagracia, but the assistant public prosecutor on duty refused to take her complaint, saying there was not enough information. as she walked to her sister's house on the morning of 14 july, gysselle baret reyes was forced at gunpoint into a black toyota camry, with blacked-out windows, in which were two hooded men and a woman. they forced her into a fetal position and questioned her about her family, including where her husbands parents lived, how many brothers he had, where emildo bueno oguis was and who was paying his legal fees. when she said she did not know, one of the group poured some kind of acid on her left arm, burning her, and told her they would throw the liquid in her face. they told her to warn emildo that he had ""meddled too deeply in this case"" (se metio muy hondo con ese caso) and that he, gysselle and minoscal would ""suffocate before wednesday"" (se van a ahogar antes de miercoles). when she went back to the police station with minoscal de olis oguiza, the same public prosecutor refused to take her statement, despite the injury to her arm and her obvious distress. background information the un special rapporteur on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and the un independent expert on minority issues, who visited the country in october 2007, found ""a profound and entrenched problem of racism and discrimination in dominican society, generally affecting blacks and particularly such groups as black dominicans, dominicans of haitian descent and haitians"" and said that circular 017 ""should be withdrawn and replaced with one which encourages an official attitude of facilitation and trust."" in february 2008 the un committee on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination expressed concern that since the introduction of circular 017, dominicans of haitian descent had had their identification documents ""confiscated and destroyed, or have been denied copies of these documents on grounds of their ethnic origin."" dominican lawyers and legal experts have spoken out about circular 017 being unconstitutional, and have called for it to be withdrawn. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing concern that gysselle baret reyes was abducted and assaulted on 14 july, and that she, minoscal de olis oguiza and emildo bueno oguis have been threatened with death;- calling on the authorities to order an immediate, thorough and independent investigation, publish the results and bring those responsible to justice;

suspension by the ankles or in contorted positions; electric shocks; and burning with cigarettes. there are also reports of mock executions, sexual abuse, including rape with bottles and sticks, and threats of sexual abuse of female relatives. as a state party to the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, tunisia is under an obligation to prevent torture and to ensure that its competent authorities proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation, wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its jurisdiction. the tunisian authorities have relentlessly used security concerns as a pretext for the repression of islamists and political dissent in general. with the introduction of the anti-terrorism law in 2003, hundreds of people have been arrested in connection with alleged terrorism-related offenses. despite amendments introduced in july 2009, annulling provisions keeping secret the identity of judges and prosecutors in counter-terrorism trials and classifying incitement to hatred as terrorist acts, unless accompanied with acts of intimidation, the law continues to contain a vague definition of terrorism acts contained in the law remains unchanged and it may still be used to criminalize freedom of expression, association and assembly. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   urging the iraqi authorities not to forcibly return mohamed ben faraj medini to tunisia where he would be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment ;

many of these are from other regions of the drc and have no family in the capital. street children are a particularly vulnerable social group, whose basic human rights are rarely respected or even acknowledged. they are frequently the victims of arbitrary arrest, detention and ill-treatment, a situation made worse by the fact that they cannot rely on relatives to locate them, organise legal assistance or bring them food. hundreds of street children have also been forcibly conscripted into the congolese armed forces. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - recognising the right of the authorities to bring to justice those responsible for criminal acts, but expressing concern at the detention of around 100 children, some as young as five years old, and over 100 adults in health-threatening conditions and urging that steps be taken to ensure the physical well-being of all the detainees, including the provision of adequate food;

imminent execution usa                 brandon rhode (m) brandon rhode, a 31-year-old white man, is due to be executed in georgia, usa, at 9pm on 24 september. he was due to be put to death on the evening of 21 september, but his execution was stayed by the georgia supreme court after brandon rhode attempted suicide. brandon rhode was scheduled to be killed by lethal injection at 7pm on 21 september 2010. that morning, his lawyers filed a motion for an emergency stay of execution in the georgia supreme court. the lawyers had learned that brandon rhode had attempted suicide that morning and had been moved from death row for treatment at an undisclosed location. the motion stated that they had been given no information on their clients whereabouts, physical condition, mental condition, details of treatment, or drugs he may have ingested or been administered. effectively, brandon rhode was without counsel and without access to the courts and remedies on the day of his scheduled execution. the lawyers argued that brandon rhode could be incompetent for execution under us constitutional law, that is that he may not have a rational understanding of the reason for and reality of his punishment. they sought access to him and his medical and prison records. the state supreme court stayed the execution. according to the department of corrections the stay is until 2pm on 23 september and is to give the lawyers time to file a claim on brandon rhodes competence for execution. the original death warrant does not expire until 28 september, and the commissioner of corrections has reset the execution for 9pm on 24 september. brandon rhode was sentenced to death in february 2000 for the murder of steven moss and his two children, aged 11 and 15, committed during a burglary of their home, on 23 april 1998. his co-defendant daniel lucas was also sentenced to death and remains on death row without an execution date. brandon rhode was only 18 years old at the time of the crime. almost all his adult life has been spent in pre-trial custody and then death row. brandon rhodes background is one of deprivation, developmental problems, and substance abuse. an expert medical opinion concluded that has significantly impaired functioning due to exposure to alcohol as a foetus. on 17 september 2010, the georgia board of pardons and paroles denied clemency. background information according to the us supreme court, capital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit a narrow category of the most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution. in 1993, in the case of a death row prisoner who was 19 at the time of the crime, the court said that: youth is more than a chronological fact. it is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage. a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults, and are more understandable among the young. these qualities often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions. in 1989, in another death penalty case, four supreme court justices had noted that age 18 is a necessarily arbitrary social choice as a point at which to acknowledge a persons maturity and responsibility, given the different developmental rates of individuals, and it is in fact a conservative estimate of the dividing line between adolescence and adulthood. many of the psychological and emotional changes that an adolescent experiences in maturing do not actually occur until the early 20s. in 2005, the supreme court finally ruled that offenders who were under 18 at the time of the crime should not be subjected to the death penalty. the decision noted that drawing the line at 18 years of age is subject, of course, to the objections always raised against categorical rules. the qualities that distinguish juveniles from adults do not disappear when an individual turns 18. brandon rhode was 18 years and nine months old at the time of the crime. brandon rhode was born in mississippi to a young mother, who as a 15-year-old was not even aware she was pregnant for the first five months. during this time she consumed alcohol and drugs. brandon rhode has been diagnosed as suffering from organic brain damage, and in 2010, using modern methods of testing, experts concluded that he definitely suffers from a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (fasd), and that his development was significantly delayed as a result of his exposure to alcohol as a fetus. dr richard adler has said that what we now know for certain in 2010 is that the brain of a healthy child continues to grow and develop and mature into the early 20s. during that time, the executive functions of the brain  impulse control, judgment, planning, appreciation of consequences, empathy, ability to course-correct  are the last areas of brain functioning to develop. this is why adolescents  even 18 year old teenagers like brandon rhode was in 1998  are definitely impaired in these areas of functioning as compared to adults. furthermore, the characteristic deficits associated with fasd only exacerbate the impairments associated with adolescent brain immaturity in effect, brandon was functioning at a considerably younger level than his chronological age at the time of the subject crimes. brandon rhode began drinking alcohol at the age of 11, and by the age of 13 was abusing alcohol and drugs regularly. he was hospitalized at the age of 13 after a suicide attempt. at 15, he dropped out of school and was sent by his mother to live with his biological father who was a drug addict and alcoholic. the teenagers own substance abuse escalated and he began to burgle houses in the pursuit of money to buy alcohol and drugs in their emergency motion filed in the georgia supreme court, brandon rhodes lawyers have drawn attention to the fact that his best friend on death row, leeland braley, committed suicide in the cell next to him on 1 january 2010. also, on 19 november 2009 another inmate, timothy pruitt, was killed or committed suicide on the same tier of death row. in early 2010 amnesty international wrote to the prison authorities to express concern at the additional hardship and source of stress that recent changes to death row conditions  with reduced out-of-cell time and imposition of non-contact visits  would place on inmates. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally in all cases. the usa has carried out 1,226 executions since 1977. there have been 38 executions in the usa this year. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   acknowledging the seriousness of the crime for which brandon rhode was sentenced to death; n   expressing concern for his mental health in view of his recent apparent suicide attempt; n   noting that brandon rhode was only 18 at

appear to have been subjected to enforced disappearance and are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. the reason for their arrests is unknown, although it may be connected to the ongoing protests against the government in iran, as the authorities have arrested many journalists, human rights defenders, students and others in recent weeks. behrang tonekaboni, who is 28, is the editor of farhang va ahang, a monthly music journal. he was arrested from his office with his colleague kayvan farzin, the journals music critic, on 5 january. there has been no news of kayvan farzins whereabouts since then. behrang tonekaboni was taken to the home he shares with his mother, which was searched and had items confiscated from it, including his mothers computer. although he telephoned his mother twice, his family have received no information on his whereabouts since his arrest [he called but was not allowed to say where he was]. he has asthma and also a heart condition. he requires regular medication. lily farhadpour, aged 47, a journalist and a member of iranian ngo mothers for peace, was arrested at her home on 20 january. her whereabouts are unknown. she suffers from diabetes for which she needs to take tablets regularly. background information mothers for peace is a group of iranian women who campaign against possible military intervention in iran over its nuclear program, seek viable solutions to the regions instability and campaign against the arrest, detention and harassment of ordinary iranians. demonstrations in iran in june and july against the disputed presidential election result of june 2009 were violently repressed, by police and the paramilitary basij militia, who used excessive force. since then, demonstrations have continued to take place on days of national importance when public demonstrations are permitted, such as qods day (18 september), the anniversary of the seizure of the american embassy (4 november), national student day (7 december), and around the religious festival of ashoura (27 december). during these protests, thousands of protestors were arrested, although many were later released. many of those arrested in the summer were tortured or otherwise ill-treated. at least three died as a result of torture in the kahrizak detention center near tehran. on 19 december 2009, a military court in tehran announced that 12 people had been charged in connection with abuses, three of whom had been charged with murder. the security forces response to the demonstrations on or following ashoura was the most violent since the early days of the protests. the opposition website jaras estimates that at least 1,300 were arrested across iran, including 600 in esfahan and 200 in najafabad, along with 500 who were acknowledged by the authorities to have been arrested in tehran. human rights groups say at least 300 detainees were held in evin prison in tehran and unconfirmed reports suggest others may have been taken to a reopened detention facility under the control of the revolutionary guards in the eshratabad complex in central tehran. the iranian authorities have made statements suggesting that protestors who riot or commit violent acts such as arson will be charged with moharebeh (enmity against god) which can carry the death penalty. on 18 january, five unnamed people went on trial charged with moharebeh in connection with the demonstrations on ashoura. since the demonstrations, well over 180 journalists, human rights activists, students and members of political parties linked to mir hossein mousavi and former president khatami are reported by jaras and other sources to have been arrested from their home or workplace, among them emaddedin baghi, recipient of the 2009 martin ennals

no lawyer was present. amnesty international does not have information about the content of the document, but fears that it is part of an attempt to forcibly return him to sudan and make it look like he agreed to being deported. muhammad babikir adam has been detained in lebanon since 29 january. on 11 march he was sentenced to one months imprisonment for violation of a deportation order. he remains detained, beyond the expiry of his sentence, while general security reportedly prepares to deport him and 48 other sudanese back to sudan. amnesty international is concerned that his conviction, sentence and resulting imprisonment may have been unlawful and in violation of international human rights law and standards concerning refugees. muhammad babikir adam is a member of the fur ethnic group, from darfur in western sudan, a region which in recent years has witnessed large-scale violations of human rights and humanitarian law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. lebanon has international obligations not to return in any circumstances any individual to a country where they would be at risk of torture. background information a conflict between various armed opposition groups and the government armed forces and their allied militias erupted in 2003 in darfur, western sudan. according to un estimates, around 300,000 people have been killed and more than 2.7 million displaced so far. the conflict has been marked by large-scale violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. the sudanese national intelligence and security services (niss) have extensive powers of arrest and detention. they are able to detain people for a period of four and a half months without judicial review under sudanese law. they have also been responsible for numerous human rights violations against people from darfur, particularly amongst internally displaced persons and members of darfurian ethnic groups, such as the furs, zaghawas and massalit. amnesty international has documented cases of prolonged detention without trial of darfurians living in both khartoum and darfur. detainees have been subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment, unfair trials, enforced disappearance and death in detention. in may 2008, the justice and equality movement, a darfur-based armed opposition group, launched an attack on the capital, khartoum. although they were stopped within hours by the sudanese armed forces, the niss then proceeded to arrest darfurians living in khartoum and throughout the country. over one thousand persons were arrested in khartoum alone in the weeks that followed the attack, mainly civilians of darfurian origin. the niss tortured and otherwise ill-treated people arrested in the aftermath of the attack. since january 2010, the humanitarian and human rights situation has seriously deteriorated in darfur, with renewed clashes and displacements all over darfur. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   urging the lebanese authorities not to forcibly return muhammad babikir abd al-aziz muhammad adam to sudan, where he would face arbitrary arrest, torture or other ill-treatment, and possibly enforced disappearance;

concern usa (louisiana)   lawrence jacobs (m), black, aged 24 the parish of jefferson, in the state of louisiana, is intending to seek a death sentence against lawrence jacobs, or to use the threat of the death penalty to coerce him into accepting a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. lawrence jacobs was 16 years old when he arrested and charged with first degree murder. international law, recognized by almost every government in the world, prohibits the use of the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of release against those who were under 18 at the time of the crime. nelson beaugh, aged 45, and his 75-year-old mother, della beaugh, were shot dead at nelson beaughs home on 31 october 1996. lawrence jacobs and roy bridgewater, who was 17 at the time of the crime, were both convicted of first degree murder and received death sentences. lawrence jacobss conviction and death sentence were overturned by the louisiana supreme court in 2001 on the grounds that he had been denied his right to an impartial jury by the inclusion of jurors who displayed a strong predisposition to imposing death sentences. the court did not address the constitutionality of executing 16-year old offenders, the lack of any direct evidence indicating that lawrence jacobs fired any shot (he maintains that he left the scene before the shootings), or the apparent racial discrimination in the selection of the jury. on the latter question it did note, however, that the prosecutors alleged racial discrimination in the selection of jurors... also appears to raise serious questions regarding the propriety of the jury selection process in the case. the prosecution had dismissed four of the five african-american jurors in the jury pool by using peremptory strikes (the right to reject jurors without giving a reason). the prosecution had also tried to dismiss the fifth african-american juror, but had been prevented from doing so by the trial judge. lawrence jacobs is black (as is roy bridgewater). both the murder victims were white. the state is seeking to retry lawrence jacobs. the prosecution has insisted that if he does not accept a plea bargain under which he pleads guilty and is sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, they will seek the death penalty again. pre-trial hearings will be held in july 2004 on the legality of executing someone who was 16 years old at the time of the crime. prior to his arrest for the crime of which he is now accused, lawrence jacobs was held at the tallulah correctional center for youth (tccy), a privately operated juvenile justice facility later closed as a result of an investigation by the civil rights division of the us department of justice. the investigation

under 18 at the time of the crime, is prohibited under international law. the geneva conventions, the international covenant on civil and political rights, the convention on the rights of the child (ratified by 192 countries), the american convention on human rights and the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, all have provisions exempting this age group from execution. since 1990, amnesty international has documented 36 executions of child offenders in eight countries  the democratic republic of congo, iran, nigeria, pakistan, saudi arabia, the usa, china and yemen. the usa carried out 19 of the executions, more than all other countries combined. in its october 2004 term, the us supreme court will revisit its 1989 decision allowing the execution of offenders who were 16 or 17 at the time of the crime. its decision is expected in early 2005. of the 38 death penalty states, louisiana has the highest percentage of african americans on its death row. in april 2004, 67 per cent of its condemned population was black. the state's population at large is 32.5 per cent black and 64 per cent white. eighty-five per cent of the inmates executed in louisiana since 1977 (23 out of 27) were put to death for the murder of white victims. they included child offender dalton prejean, executed in 1990 for the murder of a white police officer. prejean was sentenced by an all-white jury, as were at least six of the other 12 african americans put to death in the state since 1977. every child offender executed in louisiana since slavery is reported to have been black and tried in front of an all-white jury for a crime involving a white victim. ryan matthews, black, was originally sentenced to death in jefferson parish by a jury of 11 whites and one black for the murder of a white man when matthews was 17. on 18 june 2004 he was released on bail pending retrial after four separate dna tests supported his innocence claim. in a pre-trial hearing in lawrence jacobs case in 2002, one of the prosecutors wore a tie which bore the image of an executioner's noose, an image which carried echoes from jefferson parish's history of racist lynching. see usa: death by discrimination  the continuing role of race in capital cases, amr 51/046/2003, april 2003. there are around 70 child offenders on death row in the usa. the number serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole is unknown but far higher. defendants who were as young as 12 years old at the time of the crime have been sentenced to this penalty. according to information received by amnesty international there are more than 300 prisoners serving sentences of life without parole in louisiana for crimes committed when they were 15, 16 or 17. three quarters of them are black. lawrence jacobs case was previously the subject of extra 66/02 (amr 51/141/2002, 22 august 2002) and follow-ups amr 51/156/2002, 3 october

that you are not seeking to condone the manner of their deaths; - pointing out that international law prohibits the use of the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole against those who were under 18 at the time of the crime; - expressing concern that the usa is in virtual isolation on this issue internationally; - explaining that the prohibition stems from the recognition of a young

the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. when the usa ratified the convention against torture in 1994, it lodged a reservation to article 16 to the effect that it agreed to be bound by the treatys prohibition on cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment only to the extent that this term matched the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishments. in effect, the reservation can severely limit us obligations under the convention. in any event, none of the hundreds of foreign nationals held by the usa have access to the us courts to be able to challenge the conditions of their detention or seek redress for any abuses. amnesty international has welcomed the pentagons assurances, but remains concerned by the persistent allegations that have emerged from bagram. the organization has called for a full inquiry into the treatment of detainees in bagram, but has received no response from the authorities. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - seeking confirmation that algerian national adil al-jazeeri was rendered to us custody by pakistan on 13 july; - seeking information on his current whereabouts and legal status, and calling for this information to be made public; - seeking assurances that he is being treated humanely, in full accordance with international law and standards; - calling for him to be granted access to legal counsel, to medical care if needed, and to a court to be able to challenge the lawfulness of his detention; - calling for a full and impartial investigation into the allegations of ill-treatment of detainees held in bagram air base, and for the results to be made public. appeals to: donald rumsfeld secretary of defense the white house washington, dc 20301","","",1,FALSE

- urging the authorities to provide him with appropriate medical treatment should he require it; - reminding the authorities of their obligations to ensure compliance with fair trial standards in any legal proceedings against shahin agabeyli; - expressing concern at the use of criminal defamation cases to silence opposition or critical views in the media; - expressing concern that the use of defamation laws with the purpose or effect of preventing legitimate criticism of government or exposure of official wrongdoing cannot be justified; - calling for defamation to be de-criminalized and defamation suits to be resolved within the framework of civil law; - reminding the azerbaijani authorities of their obligations to uphold and maintain freedom of expression in azerbaijan. appeals to: (it may be difficult to get through to faxes but please keep trying)","","",1,FALSE

medical concern/ fear for safety tunisia fahem boukadous (m) tunisian prisoner of conscience fahem boukadous, aged 40, has been on hunger strike since 8 october 2010 in protest against his prison conditions and his continued detention in gafsa prison. he is refusing to take his medication without which his life may be in danger. fahem boukadous went on strike in protest against the worsening treatment he has received from the prison authorities. he and his wife, afef bennaceur, believe that ever since other journalists attempted a solidarity visit to the prison on saturday 18 september, he has been subjected to increased harassment by the prison guards. this includes separation from his prison inmate hassan ben abdallah, having his food extensively searched so that it becomes inedible, and having all his conversations with his wife watched, listened to and recorded. fahem boukadous suffers from acute asthma, marked by severe breathing problems for which he needs regular medication and monitoring. his medical condition has been exacerbated by prison conditions and his wife reports a gradual deterioration of his health. he has had several severe asthma attacks since being imprisoned as well as a throat infection, a tooth infection, and most recently severe stomach pains. after suffering an asthma attack on 22 september, promises by the gafsa prison authorities to take him to a hospital were not kept. he was hospitalized only 13 days later following another asthma attack on 4 october. on 9 october, on the second day of his hunger strike, fahem boukadous had another asthma attack but he insisted on struggling to get through it without his medication. as a journalist working for the private tv channel al-hiwar ettounsi, fahem boukadous covered and broadcast images of popular protests against unemployment and high living costs in the gafsa region of south-west tunisia in the first half of 2008. he was sentenced to six years imprisonment in december 2008 for allegedly belonging to the group that had led the unrests. he was found guilty on retrial in january 2010 his sentence reduced to four years. background information following protests in gafsa against unemployment, corruption, and high living costs in the first half of 2008, the tunisian authorities began a violent crackdown, forcibly dispersing protests and arresting hundreds of people. in december 2008, the gafsa court of first instance sentenced a group of 38 trade unionists and protesters, including fahem boukadous and hassen ben abdallah, to prison terms for allegedly leading the unrest. fahem boukadous, a journalist, had reported on the protests for the private television channel al-hiwar ettounsi. the investigating judge concluded that although fahem boukadous did not participate directly in the protests, he was an active member of the group leading the unrest because he spread information in tunisia and abroad for ""propaganda"". fahem boukadous, who went into hiding at the time, was tried in his absence and sentenced to six years imprisonment. the conviction was upheld on appeal in february 2009. he was charged with ""belonging to a criminal association"", ""taking part in a group established to prepare or commit an attack against people or property"" and ""spreading information liable to disrupt public order"". in november 2009, all those convicted and imprisoned during the crackdown were conditionally released following a presidential pardon to mark the 22nd anniversary of ben alis accession to power. the presidential pardon applied only to those whose sentences are considered final, not to those who went into hiding and were tried in their absence. fahem boukadous came out of hiding and was retried and convicted again in january 2010 but his sentence was reduced to four years. the conviction was upheld in july 2010 by the gafsa court of appeals. fahem boukadous was taken into custody on 15 july 2010, a week after his conviction was upheld. fahem boukadous had been hospitalized repeatedly between april 2010 and july 2010 for breathing difficulties and was arrested just after he was discharged from hospital. he is currently held in gafsa prison. amnesty international contends that his trial did not conform to international standards for fair trial. in the first instance, defense lawyers were unable to present the case and the defense lawyers demands to cross-examine witnesses were rejected. on appeal, the lawyers were able to present their arguments to the court, but were again denied the right to call and cross-examine witnesses. the trial was marked by a heavy security presence, both inside and outside the court room. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n

instead, fatemeh salbehis husbands blood relatives will decide whether to insist on her execution, or to accept compensation. in january 2007, the committee on the rights of the child, which oversees the implementation of the convention on the rights of the child, made general comment 52 that legal or other appropriate assistance must be present for children (defined as under the age of 18), beginning from the interrogation by the police and during all subsequent proceedings, not limited to only judicial proceedings.  fatemeh salbehi was interrogated by the police without the presence of a lawyer.  furthermore, it not known whether fatemeh salbehi was provided with any other type of assistance during the police interrogation when she made her confession.  during the trial, fatemeh salbehi retracted her confession. according to article 111 of the iranian penal code, sodomy is punishable by death, although the method of execution is at the discretion of the judge.  there is no separate offense of rape in the iranian penal code, and allegations of rape are dealt with under this article.  a male rape victim is not liable to execution under this law. the execution of juvenile offenders is prohibited under international law, including article 6(5) of the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) and the convention on the rights of the child (crc), to which iran is a state party. however, since 1990, iran has executed at least 47 juvenile offenders  that is, people convicted of having committed crimes which took place when they were under 18 years old. eight of these executions were in 2008 and five in 2009. the last juvenile offender known to be executed was a youth known only as mohammad a. who was executed on 10 july 2010 in marvdasht, shiraz.  he had been convicted of alleged rape and murder when he was 17.  amnesty international has compiled a list of over 140 juvenile offenders sentenced to death in recent years, although it is difficult to monitor their subsequent fate. when iran ratified the convention of the rights of the child, iran's council of guardians, (a body of 12 jurists which reviews all laws for conformity to the constitution and to islamic law) clarified that it regarded certain articles to be in contravention of sharia law and would not therefore apply to the convention entered by iran.  however, the council of guardians did not include article 37 in its list, which states no child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offenses committed by persons below eighteen years of age.  in practice, this prohibition as been ignored by iranian judges and iran is one of only a handful of countries to sentence to death alleged juvenile offenders. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   calling on the iranian authorities to halt the executions of fatemeh salbehi and ehsan, and commute their death sentence;

whilst tite mitaga, ndayizeye, emmanuel nzohabonimana, mastajabu have been detained since february. all are accused of common law offences. under the burundian code of penal criminal procedures, detainees may be held for a period of seven days which may be extended once, before being either charged  and transferred to a prison or remand centre  or released. all the men are therefore held illegally. unless they are brought to court the men have no chance to challenge the legal basis for their detention. background information while conditions of detention in burundis main prisons have improved over the last few years, standards still fall far short of internationally recognized standards. in particular, prisons are seriously overcrowded and continue to lack basic facilities, including medical care, and provide barely minimum food supplies. while burundis prisons have a total capacity of approximately 3,600, there are nearly 8,500 people in detention. many of the prison buildings are in poor condition, and in the current economic climate, it is unlikely that without further international assistance they will be improved. although many prisoners who are unable to supplement their diet with food from outside remain under-nourished, and are therefore particularly vulnerable to diseases prevalent in conditions of close confinement, mortality rates generally have fallen dramatically in prisons as a result of detainees having access to clean water and some medical care. such improvements do not in the main affect other places of detention, in particular those controlled by the gendarmerie and military, and those in provinces or communes far from the capital. conditions are often reported to be far worse than in central prisons. access by human rights and humanitarian groups is routinely denied to military and paramilitary places of detention. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing concern for health and general well-being of the men named above (please give names) who have been detained for long periods of time in extremely poor conditions at the police de scurit publique (psp), public security police, kirundo;

are being held in police detention in diyarbakir, southeast turkey, where they have reportedly been tortured and ill-treated. amnesty international is concerned for their safety. remzi karaduman, ugur usar and resat usar were detained by police officers from the anti-terror branch of ankara police headquarters on 26 july. two days later they were handed over to the anti-terror branch of police headquarters in diyarbakir. on 30 july, a court ordered that they be remanded to diyarbakir prison. a lawyer met with remzi karaduman, ugur usar and resat usar in prison the following day, 31 july. the group related that they had been subjected to torture and ill-treatment including beating and electric shocks while in police detention in ankara. this reportedly worsened after they were transferred to police detention in diyarbakir. there they were also apparently sprayed repeatedly with pressurized water, had their testicles squeezed, were blindfolded continuously, forced to stay standing by having their wrists handcuffed to an elevated point, not given anything to eat or drink, and two police officers would force the detainees heads between their legs by sitting on their shoulders. as a result of the reported ill-treatment, remzi karaduman and resat usar cannot sleep at night and there is apparently blood in their urine. their lawyer observed that all three men were in a bad physical and psychological state and that there was especially severe bruising and marks of beating on the arms and legs of remzi karaduman. on the basis of the testimonies of remzi karaduman, ugur usar and resat usar, the lawyer lodged a complaint about the alleged torture and ill-treatment with the diyarbakir prosecutor. as a result of this complaint, on 1 august the three men were taken from prison to be examined by doctors at the local institute of forensic medicine who determined that they should be examined instead at the medical faculty of dicle university, where there was a greater level of expertise in documenting such injuries. however, on the same day diyarbakir state security court (dgm) ordered that remzi karaduman, ugur usar and resat usar be brought instead to the anti-terror branch of diyarbakir police headquarters for further interrogation. this was carried out under legal decree 430 which allows individuals to be returned from prison to police detention for an additional 10 days of questioning. consequently, the three men were not taken to the medical faculty of dicle university but were taken back into police detention where they are at risk of further torture and ill-treatment. background information amnesty international has received numerous accounts of people being illegally detained and tortured by police in diyarbakir under article 3/c of legal decree no. 430, which allows individuals in the region under state of emergency to be returned from prison to police detention for an additional ten days of questioning. the article can be applied again after the end of the 10 days. in this way individuals can be held in detention for long periods of time (see report turkey: torture and prolonged detention in the region under state of emergency , ai index: eur 44/10/2002). there are many documented instances of individuals being tortured while in prolonged detention. for example, fesih gler was reportedly tortured while held illegally at the anti-terror branch of police headquarters, while fahrettin zdemir spent a total of 59 days in police custody, during which time he was reportedly severely tortured (extra 30/00 issued 3 april 2000). whereas torture is rarely reported from prisons, in police and gendarmerie stations it appears to be regularly used to extract confessions, elicit information about illegal organizations, intimidate detainees into becoming police informers, or as unofficial punishment for presumed support of illegal organizations. torture methods in turkey documented by amnesty international include severe beatings, being stripped naked and blindfolded, hosing with pressurized ice-cold water, suspending by the arms or wrists bound behind the victim's back, electric shocks, beating the soles of the feet, death threats and sexual assault. the turkish regulation on apprehension, police custody and interrogation provides clear guidelines for the registration of people taken into custody. it also provides guidelines on an individuals right to inform their relatives unless informing the relatives will harm the investigation ;. in an amendment to the constitution on 3 october 2001, this restriction was lifted. yet guidelines for the prompt and proper registration of detainees and for notification of their families are often ignored. this is extremely distressing for the families of detainees, who often spend days trying to establish the whereabouts of their loved ones. failure to register detainees properly and promptly creates conditions in which there is an increased risk of torture, and ""disappearance"" or death in custody can occur. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing concern for the safety of remzi

the police to tell them that castillo had said that he had murdered an 86-year-old lady in her sleep after he had entered the house to burgle it. castillo was arrested, waived his right to a lawyer, and subsequently confessed to murder, robbery and arson. after the jury convicted william castillo on all counts, the trial moved into a sentencing phase. evidence of castillos troubled childhood was presented. he had begun running away from home at the age of nine. by the age of 15, he had already been charged with attempted murder and arson, and had used marijuana, speed, cocaine and alcohol. a neuro-psychologist testified that william castillo had been emotionally, mentally and physically abused, and came from a dysfunctional family. his mother testified that her son had a difficult childhood due to the physical and emotional abuse he suffered at the hands of his father and the familys instability. william castillo testified as to his regret and remorse about his conduct. the prosecutor urged the jury to pass a death sentence: the issue is do you, as the trial jury, this afternoon have the resolve and the intestinal fortitude, the sense of commitment to do your legal and moral duty, for whatever your decision is todayyou will be imposing a judgment of death and its just a question of whether it will be an execution sentence for the killer of mrs berndt or for a future victim of this defendant. the jury found in mitigation william castillos youth at the time of the crime and that the murder was committed when he was under the influence of extreme emotional distress or disturbance. however, it concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed this and returned athe prosecutor urged the jury to pass a death sentence: the issue is do you, as the trial jury, this afternoon have the resolve and the intestinal fortitude, the sense of commitment to do your legal and moral duty, for whatever your decision is todayyou will be imposing a judgment of death and its just a question of whether it will be an execution sentence for the killer of mrs berndt or for a future victim of this defendant. the jury found in mitigation william castillos youth at the time of the crime and that the murder was committed when he was under the influence of extreme emotional distress or disturbance. however, it concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed this and returned a verdict of death. in 1998, the nevada supreme court concluded that portions of the prosecutors future dangerousness argument were improper. the prosecutors comment about the future victim of william castillo had improperly suggest[ed] that the jury must decide whether to execute the defendant or bear responsibility for the death of an innocent future victim. presenting the jurys decision as a choice between killing a guilty person or an innocent person will likely result in a jurors decision to impose the death penalty more often than if the jurys decision had been portrayed in its proper light. however, the court ruled that this prosecutorial misconduct had not unfairly prejudiced william castillo in light of the overwhelming evidence of his guilt. guilt, however, was not the issue at the sentencing phase. william castillo, who has been on death row for more than a decade, has waived his federal appeals. he has reportedly stated that he does not want to serve a life sentence in a nevada prison if he wins an appeal against his death sentence. background information over one in 10 of the more than 1,000 men and women put to death in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977 had given up their appeals (see prisoner-assisted homicide  more volunteer executions loom, may 2007, http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engamr510872007 ). any number of factors may contribute to a condemned inmates decision not to pursue appeals, including mental disorder, physical illness, remorse, bravado, religious belief, a quest for notoriety, the severity of conditions of confinement, including prolonged isolation and lack of physical contact visits, the bleak alternative of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, or pessimism about appeal prospects. in some cases it appears that the detainee may have committed the crime in order to receive a death sentence. pre-trial or post-conviction suicidal ideation seems to motivate the decision-making of some such inmates, including some whose abusive childhoods have left them traumatized or suffering mental health problems. with such cases in mind, the execution of ""volunteers"" is often compared to state-assisted suicide. however, ""prisoner-assisted homicide"" may be a more appropriate description of this phenomenon. rational or irrational, an inmates decision to waive appeals may simply stem from a desire to gain a semblance of control over a situation in which they are otherwise powerless. as the us supreme court recognized over a century ago, ""when a prisoner sentenced by a court to death is confined in the penitentiary awaiting the execution of the sentence, one of the most horrible feelings to which he can be subjected during that time is the uncertainty during the whole of it, as to the precise time when his execution shall take place."" one way for a prisoner to end this cruel uncertainty is to ask to be killed by the state. death row conditions in the usa have become increasingly harsh over the years, with inmates spending more time in isolation. death row inmates are typically confined to their cells for most of the day, and have little or no access to educational or other programs. the sense of isolation may be one reason why 11 out of 12 of the people put to death in nevada between 1977 and today had given up their appeals. nevadas death row is based at ely, in the east of the state. it is situated some 400 kilometers from las vegas and over 500 km from reno, the two main centers of population in one of the least densely populated us states. given the rate of error found in capital cases on appeal, if the more than 120 ""volunteers"" executed since 1977 had pursued their appeals, there is a significant possibility that a number of them would have had their death sentences overturned to prison terms. to look at it another way, the phenomenon of ""volunteers"" contributes to the arbitrariness that riddles the use of the death penalty in the usa. a number of recent executions of non-volunteers have been stayed following the us supreme courts decision to review the constitutionality of lethal injection procedures used in kentucky (the same as used in most states). amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of the crime, issues of guilt or innocence, or the method used to kill the condemned prisoner. today, 133 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast, the usa has carried out 1,099 executions since judicial killing resumed there in 1977. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - explaining that you are not seeking to condone the murder of isabelle berndt or to downplay the suffering caused, but opposing the execution of william castillo, and the death penalty in general; - expressing concern at the high number of death row inmates who have waived their appeals in nevada, a phenomenon that contributes to the arbitrariness of the death penalty; - noting the increased national concern about the fairness and reliability of the capital justice system; - calling for a moratorium on executions in nevada, with a

order to make them confess. the court has dismissed their complaints due to lack of evidence. the nine were among 25 men who had already been detained for some time when police formally arrested them in august 2007, during a national strike hard anti-crime campaign. they were charged in december 2008 with crimes including forming and leading organizations of the nature of criminal syndicates and participating in organizations of the nature of criminal syndicates. according to a local press report, their lawyers argued that they were not members of a criminal gang or involved in organized crime. the nine men, among them wang yuefeng, wang zhiqiang and yu long, each independently told their lawyers they had been tortured during interrogation. they said police officers had poured mustard sauce into their noses and given them electric shocks to the head, legs and genitals. wang yuefeng had been deprived of sleep for six days. each had his hands tied behind his back with a towel, by which he was repeatedly hung from the ceiling, some of them for 25 to 40 minutes each time. wang zhiqiang was beaten by police, who broke his right thumb. yu long, who was given electric shocks to his legs and feet, now has trouble walking. wang yuefang says during interrogation he was moved between unofficial places of detention, where he was tortured. all nine say they confessed to make the torture stop. the men say the police forced them to wear helmets to prevent them from harming themselves. the trial took place from 11-14 august in the shangqiu city intermediate peoples court. a verdict is expected on 13 october. background information the legal action in this case has been full of procedural irregularities. the police did not tell the mens families that they had been detained or why this had been done, though by they law they have to do this. nor did they tell the families where they were held, or that they had the right to legal counsel of their choice. the mens families hired lawyers to represent them, but when they tried to visit the men, they were turned away, on the grounds that the case involved state secrets. however, no state secrets charges were brought against the men. the lawyers wrote to the national peoples congress and the supreme peoples procuratorate in early 2009 to complain about the men's treatment. during the trial on 11-14 august, the shangqiu city intermediate peoples court announced that the liangyuan district peoples procuratorate, in shangqiu city, henan province, had carried out an investigation into the torture allegations in may 2009. as part of the investigation, procuratorate staff had interviewed detention center officials and examined the detention and interrogation records. however, the court dismissed the torture claims due to lack of evidence. the men were deemed healthy and the burn injuries to yu longs foot were attributed to spilled hot water. in china, the criminal procedure law (cpl) does not explicitly prohibit the use of confessions obtained through torture or other ill-treatment as evidence before the courts. this is required by the un convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which china ratified in 1988. despite this, torture and other ill-treatment are endemic in all places of detention. amnesty international also receives regular reports of deaths in custody, many of them caused by torture, in a variety of state institutions, including prisons and police detention centers. the broad discretion given to the police by the cpl to detain suspects for long periods before trial increases opportunities for torture and other ill-treatment. during this time detainees access to their families and legal representatives is restricted. under the cpl, the police should tell detainees families that they have been detained or arrested, and where they are held, within 24 hours, except where it would hinder the investigation (articles 64 and 71). however, in practice communication with the family is frequently denied until detainees are brought to trial or sentenced. the chinese authorities commonly launch strike hard campaigns on crime ahead of major events, such as the national day (1 october) or lunar new year (late january or early february). during the strike hard campaigns, police, prosecutors and judges are under pressure to demonstrate speed and resolve to meet quotas at the expense of procedural protections and justice. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   calling on

(ua 141/01 issued 6 june 2001; ua 168/01 issued 6 july 2001 and ua 192/01 issued 30 july 2001.) the intimidation and threats directed at ajr and caldh come in the context of a wave of abuses including death threat, attacks, office break-ins and interference with electronic communications and data directed at human rights groups and others involved in initiatives to combat impunity. the situation has become so severe that incidents are reported on an almost daily basis, leading amnesty international to consider that the human rights community in guatemala is living under a virtual state of siege. rather than condemn such abuses and attempt to bring their perpetrators to justice, the authorities have made a series of statements which appear to declare open season on human rights defenders. (ua 309/00 issued 6 october 2000; ua 265/00, issued 8 may 2001, ua 315/00 issued 8 may 2001 and ua 225/01 issued 21 september 2001 for some recent examples of abuses directed at those involved in or reporting on anti-impunity initiatives and other human rights issues.) recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - insisting that the authorities take steps to guarantee the security of employees at the centre particularly ruth carrido and any guests staying there, now and in the future; - calling on them to also investigate the apparent interference with the telephones at the centre and the threatening telephone calls directed at ruth carrido; - urging the authorities to take immediate and effective measures to investigate the break-in at the sister parish centre in guatemala city on the night of 13-14 october and to bring those responsible to justice. note that the incident falls into the pattern evident over the last year, of a sustained attack on human rights defenders, which the authorities appear to have done little to investigate and halt. - urging that the authorities make public their support for the work of human rights defenders and their intention to prosecute anyone, who makes statements which appear intended to place the lives and physical security of such individuals and organisations in danger. appeals to: president lic. alfonso portillo cabrera presidente de la repblica de guatemala 6a. avenida a 4-41, zona 1 ciudad de guatemala , guatemala","","2001-06-06",1,FALSE

however, these charges can only be brought against a limited range of officials in particular circumstances or places. the prosecuting authorities, who also investigate and prosecute torture offences, set criteria for taking up cases which further limit the application of these provisions. the chinese authorities often label any independent expression of uighur ethnic identity as separatism or religious extremism and have since mid-1990s mounted an aggressive campaign against these so-called three forces. subsequently many uighurs are arbitrarily detained and imprisoned as prisoners of conscience. the situation has worsened following the attacks in the usa on 11 september 2011 as the chinese authorities have used the global ""war on terror"" to justify harsh repression against uighurs. rebiya kadeer's family has been targeted by the authorities since she was first detained as a prisoner of conscience in 1999. this intensified after she was released on medical parole on 17 march 2005, and left china for the usa. rebiya kadeer claims to have been warned that if she engaged with members of the uighur ethnic community or spoke publicly about ""sensitive issues"", her ""businesses and children would be finished"". on 27 november 2006, the day after rebiya kadeer was elected president of the world uyghur congress (wuc), a court sentenced two of her sons, alim abdiriyim and kahar abdiriyim, to fines amounting to millions of us dollars, and alim to seven years imprisonment on charges of tax evasion. in addition, at the beginning of april, the chinese authorities reportedly began a process to assess and liquidate the kadeer family businesses. on 5 july 2009, a police crackdown on an initially peaceful demonstration by uighurs in urumqi was followed by violent riots. chinese authorities, within hours, blamed overseas chinese groups, including the world uyghur congress and rebiya kadeer, for what they described as premeditated violence. rebiya kadeer has denied the allegation. the demonstration in urumqi was in reaction to the perceived inaction by the authorities following killings of migrant uighur factory workers in guangdong province, southern china. the protests took place against a back-drop of uighur resentment, built-up over years of official repression and discrimination. chinese officials said that 197 people died in the violence on 5 july. of those killed, 156 were described as ""innocent people"" who included 134 ethnic han chinese, 11 hui, 10 uighurs and one manchurian. amnesty international interviews with eyewitnesses following the unrest suggest that excessive force on the part of security forces resulted in possibly hundreds of additional uighur deaths. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   calling on the authorities to release ablikim abdiryim immediately and unconditionally;

penalty usa  martin grossman (m) martin grossman, a 45-year-old white man, is due to be executed in the us state of florida at 6pm on 16 february for a crime committed when he was 19 years old. he was convicted of murder in 1985, and has been on death row for nearly a quarter of a century. margaret park, a 26-year-old woman employed as a wildlife officer by the state game and fish commission, was shot dead while on patrol in coastal mid-western florida on 13 december 1984. about two weeks later, 19-year-old martin grossman and thayne taylor, aged 17, were arrested (see overleaf). the two were tried jointly. grossman was convicted of first-degree murder. taylor was convicted of third-degree murder, a non-capital offence. at the sentencing for martin grossman, the defense presented four witnesses  the defendants mother, a childhood friend, and two correctional staff  in an attempt to portray his positive attributes to counter the facts of the crime on which the state was relying to obtain a death sentence. however, the jury voted for death, the judge accepted its recommendation, rejected grossmans young age as a mitigating factor, and determined that there were no mitigating factors. the aggravating factors were held to include that the murder was committed to avoid arrest and that it was especially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel. the appeal courts have rejected the claim that grossman received inadequate representation at the sentencing phase. in an affidavit, grossman's lead trial lawyer said that he and his defense colleague had done a very poor and ineffective job. upholding the death sentence in 2005, however, a federal judge ruled that this view was premised on the benefit of hindsight. the second defense lawyer, who had been hired only two weeks before the sentencing to prepare mitigation evidence, stated that they should have told the trial judge that they were not ready. the defense presented no expert mental health testimony, after their court-appointed psychologist told them that his assessment of grossman had uncovered no problems serious enough to aid their defense. however, a forensic psychologist hired by martin grossman's lawyers several years after his conviction drew a different conclusion after a more thorough assessment. he concluded that there was much mental health evidence that called into question the notion that martin grossman had acted in premeditated fashion at the time of the crime or that should serve as mitigating evidence. martin grossman had ""compromised intellectual functioning, probable brain dysfunction"", and a developmental history characterized by profound and untreated complicated bereavement  (including as a result of the death in 1981 of his father, during whose long and serious illness martin had acted as primary care-giver)  a high level of fear and depression, and parental neglect, abandonment and mistreatment. background information according to the trial record, martin grossman and thayne taylor had driven to a wooded area on the night of 13 december 1984 to shoot a handgun that grossman had recently obtained. the two teenagers were confronted by margaret park who found the gun and began to radio the police. martin grossman, who was on probation at the time following a burglary conviction, pleaded with her not to turn him in as it would mean going back to prison. when she refused, he grabbed her torch and repeatedly struck her with it, with taylor coming to his assistance. margaret park managed to draw her gun, and fire off a shot before martin grossman grabbed the weapon and fired a single shot which struck the officer in the head. about two weeks later, grossman and taylor were arrested after an acquaintance, brian allan, told the police that they had admitted to the crime. the two had also apparently told another friend, brian hancock, of the shooting, and martin grossman also allegedly related the details of the shooting to a jail mate, charles brewer. the two defendants were tried jointly, over the objection of martin grossmans lawyer. the prosecution introduced the testimony of allan, hancock and brewer against grossman. it introduced against thayne taylor the statement that taylor had given to the police. the jury was instructed that it could only use it against taylor, not grossman. while the courts have ruled that it was a constitutional error against grossman to admit taylors statement in this way, they have ruled that the error was harmless given the other testimony pointing to grossmans dominant role in the crime. in 1990, charles brewer signed an affidavit retracting his trial testimony against grossman. he said that he assisted the authorities because he believed they would help him with his own case. he said that the authorities had told him to continue talking to grossman and had fed him questions to ask. among other things, brewer had testified that grossman had told him that he had shot margaret park because he did not want to be arrested by a woman. in his affidavit, he said that the prosecutors emphasized to him the female officer thing when they were preparing him to testify. during the trial, the prosecution had repeatedly emphasized the suggestion that gender had been part of the motive for the killing. in his affidavit, charles brewer said that i cannot say martin told me that and martin never said he shot her. on 14 january 2010, the florida supreme court overturned the death sentence of another inmate, paul johnson, after finding that the state had induced him to make incriminating statements to a jailhouse informant, and because the prosecutor had known the statements were impermissibly elicited and yet had introduced them at the 1988 trial. on 21 january 2010, a florida judge rejected the argument that grossman should receive the same relief as johnson, on the grounds that there was no evidence that the state knew brewers testimony was false at the time of grossmans trial. this and other issues are currently on appeal to the florida supreme court. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. to end the death penalty is to abandon a destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly, to the public purse as well as in social and psychological terms. it has not been proven to have a special deterrent effect. it tends to be applied in a discriminatory way, on grounds of race and economic and social status. it denies the possibility of reconciliation and rehabilitation. it promotes simplistic responses to complex human problems, rather than pursuing explanations that could inform positive strategies. it prolongs the suffering of murder victims families, and extends that suffering to the loved ones of the condemned prisoner. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. the usa has carried out 1,193 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977. florida accounts for 68 of these executions. there have been five executions in the usa this year. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the killing of margaret park; n   noting martin grossmans young age at the time of the crime, and that he has spent 24 years on death row; n   expressing concern that the jury heard no expert mental health testimony, noting the post-conviction assessment; n

imminent execution usa (texas) timothy adams (m), aged 42 timothy adams, a 42-year-old african american man, is scheduled to be executed in texas on 22 february.  he was sentenced to death for the murder of his young son in 2002. three of the 12 jurors who voted for death at his trial in 2003 are among those now appealing for clemency. timothy (tim) adams shot his 19-month-old son timothy (tj) during a stand-off with police in houston, texas, on 20 february 2002. after surrendering, he gave police a statement admitting to the murder. he pleaded guilty at his trial. the jury convicted him, and after a sentencing phase voted that, even though he had no prior criminal record, he would likely commit future acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society  a prerequisite for a death sentence in texas  and that there was insufficient mitigating evidence to warrant a life sentence. although the defense lawyers presented a number of character witnesses at the sentencing, they presented only one family member, the defendants mother. other relatives of tim adams  who are also members of the murder victims family  are now appealing for clemency. for example, tim adamss father  the grandfather of the victim  has said: losing tj was especially hard for me however, i cannot imagine losing my son to this tragedy as well i do not know what i will do if we lose tim. the brother of tim adams has said its hard to explain why tim did what he did it was totally out of character i still have a strong relationship with him. i often break down when i leave the prison after our visits. i cannot imagine losing my brother. his sister states: its going to affect my family in a bad way if he is executed. i would never wish this on anyone, even my worst enemy... this would just be another huge loss to our family. tim adams has a 23-year-old son from a previous relationship who has said: i cant put my finger on why my father would do something like that. yet, my father was very loving and taught me right from wrong when i was growing up. he was a good father. he is not a bad person. i wish i had had the opportunity to say something in support of my father at his trial. three of the jurors from the original trial are also supporting clemency. one of them has said that she initially voted for a life sentence, but felt pressured by the other jurors to change my vote. she said that she has carried the guilt around for years knowing that i sentenced adams, a man who had done wrong but who was otherwise a good, religious, and hard-working person, to death. another former juror recalled that adams was so remorseful during the trial, and i could tell that he was hurting a lot. however, she said that he too had felt pressured by other jurors into believing that adams was a cold-hearted man and had voted for death. both jurors said that they had learned more about tim adams since the trial that confirmed their original leaning to vote for a life sentence. tim adams is reported not to have committed a single disciplinary infraction during his eight years on death row. background information a few days before the 20 february 2002 shooting in houston, tim adamss wife had moved out of their flat, taking the baby with her. on 20 february, she returned to the apartment to collect her belongings. confronted by her husband, she telephoned the police. tim adams fired a shot at her, and she fled the home, leaving the child behind. in the ensuing stand-off, tim adams told police that he was suicidal and would kill himself if anyone tried to enter the apartment. he was eventually talked into surrendering. his young son had already been shot. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally, regardless of the crime or the offender. to end the death penalty is to abandon a destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly, in social and psychological terms as well as to the public purse (a fact which is drawing increasing public concern in the usa in the current economic climate). it has not been proved to have a unique deterrent effect. it tends to be applied in a discriminatory way, on grounds of race and class. it denies the possibility of reconciliation and rehabilitation. it promotes simplistic responses to complex human problems, rather than pursuing explanations that could inform positive strategies. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. the death penalty extends the suffering of the victims family to that of the condemned prisoner. today, 139 countries are abolitionist in law or practice, a clear majority. such countries have concluded either that the death penalty is unnecessary, or that it is incompatible with modern standards of justice, or both. while international law recognizes that some countries retain the death penalty, this acknowledgment of present reality should not be invoked to delay or to prevent the abolition of capital punishment, in the words of article 6.6 of the international covenant on civil and political rights. in 2007, 2008 and 2010, the united nations general assembly passed resolutions calling for a worldwide moratorium on executions, pending abolition. there have been 1,239 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977, including five so far this year. of the 464 prisoners put to death in texas (37 per cent of the national total), 115 were convicted in harris county, where tim adams was sentenced to death. if harris county was a state, it would account for more executions than any other state in

international fears that he may not have access to appropriate medical care to treat his illnesses. abdul hamid al-ghizzawi has told his lawyer that his health began to worsen during his first year of detention at guantnamo and has steadily deteriorated over the five years of his detention. he learned in september 2006 that doctors at the guantnamo hospital had earlier diagnosed him with hepatitis b and tuberculosis. after visiting abdul hamid al-ghizzawi in may 2007, his lawyer described the condition of his health as alarming. his face was drawn and his skin looked both ashen and jaundiced. he had a difficult time focusing on anythinghe was in constant visible painhe was very weak and tired[he] told me he could not walk more that a few feet before being overcome with fatigue. his lawyer most recently visited him in september 2007 and she has stated that he could barely walk and during the meeting was doubled over with pain. she has expressed fears for his life. amnesty international fears that abdul hamid al-ghizzawi may not be receiving appropriate medical treatment. the commander of the guantnamo hospital and joint-task force surgeon has previously stated that abdul hamid al-ghizzawi does not want to be treated for his illnesses. however his lawyers have asserted that neither he nor they were informed of the diagnosis until september 2006 and that he has since requested treatment but has received none. abdul hamid al-ghizzawi was transferred to guantnamos camp 6 in december 2006. at camp 6, the harshest of the detention facilities at guantnamo, detainees are confined in conditions of extreme isolation and sensory deprivation for a minimum of 22 hours a day in individual steel cells with no windows to the outside. amnesty international is concerned that conditions in camp 6 could have a serious adverse effect on the psychological and physical health of the detainees held there, exacerbating the stress inherent in their indefinite detention without trial or access to their families. in february 2007, during her first visit to guantnamo since abdul hamid al-ghizzawi had been transferred to camp 6, his lawyer stated that he was stooping low to the floor and huddled against the wall when i entered. his arms were wrapped around his body as he tried to warm himself from the chill he has had for over two months, and his feet were shackled to the floor. he was shivering, his teeth were clenched and he would not look at me. during the visit he also stated that he was vomiting several times a day, had frequent headaches, itchy skin, pain in his back, abdomen, frequent nosebleeds and pain in his gums. the extreme isolation, punishment regime and other harsh conditions in camp 6 are also reported to have had a severely adverse affect on his psychological health. he is reported to have begun talking to himself and has difficulty focusing or concentrating in conversation with his lawyer. in november 2004, a combatant status review tribunal (csrt) panel determined unanimously that abdul hamid al-ghizzawi was not an enemy combatant due to the paucity and weakness of the information provided. however, a second panel, convened just two months later without the detainees presence or knowledge, concluded that he was an enemy combatant. abdul hamid al-ghizzawi was 39 years old when he was captured in afghanistan by the northern alliance forces towards the end of 2001. he was sold to us forces and later transferred to guantnamo via us-run detention centres in afghanistan. he had been living in afghanistan since 1989 and is married to an afghan woman. his daughter, now nearly six years old, was only six months old at the time of his capture. background information approximately 330 detainees from over 30 countries remain detained without trial in guantnamo. the majority of them are held in conditions of isolation in camps 5, 6 and camp echo. camp 6 was built to house 178 detainees. it is surrounded by high concrete walls. contrary to international standards, the cells have no access to natural light or air, and are lit by fluorescent lighting which is on 24 hours a day and controlled by guards. the lighting is reportedly dimmed at night, although it is unclear by how much. the only source of air in the cells is from air-conditioning controlled by guards. detainees are also subjected to loss of privileges punishment where basic provisions such as thermal shirts can be taken away as punishment. the lack of human contact in camp 6 appears to be reinforced by other operating procedures. the cell doors are operated by remote control, and guards escorting the detainees to and from the exercise yard wear thick gloves. there is an opening in the door through which food is slotted so that detainees rarely come into direct contact with another human being. guards are reportedly silent during most of their contact with detainees. detainees are also escorted in shackles whenever they leave their cells. for further information, see usa: cruel and inhuman: conditions of isolation for detainees at guantnamo bay, april 2007, http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engamr510512007 . there is a significant body of evidence in the usa and elsewhere that prolonged isolation can cause serious psychological and physical harm, particularly if accompanied by other deprivations such as conditions of reduced sensory stimulation, enforced idleness and confinement to an enclosed space. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing your serious

provides for alien unlawful enemy combatants to be tried by military commissions in proceedings which amnesty international fears will not meet international fair trial standards; and deepens an existing pattern of impunity for human rights violations committed by us personnel in the war on terror. in addition, according to president bush, the principle purpose and effect of the act is to allow the central intelligence agency (cia) to continue its secret detention program without fear of being sued in us courts. the interrogation techniques used in this program remain classified, but are widely reported to have included methods which violate the international prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. president bush stated that the act complies with both the spirit and the letter of our international obligations. amnesty international disagrees. indeed, the president signed the act into law only a matter of weeks after both the un human rights committee and the un committee against torture had reminded the usa that secret detention, indefinite detention without charge, and denial of habeas corpus violate the usas treaty obligations, and called on the usa to ensure that all interrogation techniques complied with international law and that there were effective means to bring violators to account and to provide reparation for victims. the military commissions act strips the us courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider the military commissions act strips the us courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider habeas corpus appeals from any non-us citizen held in us custody as an unlawful enemy combatant, broadly defined. if the law is upheld by the courts, no such detainee held in us custody in guantnamo or afghanistan (currently numbering about 1,000 people), or elsewhere, would be able to challenge the lawfulness or conditions of their detention in a habeas corpus petition in the us courts. as the law would apply retroactively, it means that more than 200 appeals already filed in us courts on behalf of guantnamo detainees could be thrown out. habeas corpus is a basic safeguard against arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, secret detention, and torture or other ill-treatment. as the un human rights committee has affirmed in its authoritative interpretation of the international covenant on civil and political rights, even in an emergency that threatens the life of the nation, in order to protect non-derogable rights, the right to take proceedings before a court to enable the court to decide without delay on the lawfulness of detention, must not be diminished. the new act allows president bush to establish, and the secretary of defense to convene, trials by military commission. amnesty international has serious concerns about whether any trial held under the act would comply with international standards. there are serious questions about whether military commissions will be - and will be seen to be - competent, independent and impartial, given the overarching role that the executive will play in deciding who appears before the commissions and what procedures will be applied. issues that could arise in any particular case due to a lack of fair trial guarantees written into the act include whether the defendant will be represented by counsel of his choosing; whether the commission will reject any and all evidence coerced by unlawful methods, including torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and whether any use of hearsay and classified evidence is matched by stringently applied safeguards, and whether the defendant is able effectively to challenge such evidence. the commissions will have the power to hand down death sentences, a punishment that amnesty international opposes in all cases. background information the military commissions act is the response of the us administration and congress to the us supreme courts ruling in hamdan v. rumsfeld of 29 june 2006, which found that the military commissions established by president bush under a 2001 military order were unlawful. by finding article 3 common to the four geneva conventions of 1949 to be applicable, the supreme court punctured a central tenet of the administrations policy implemented after its invasion of afghanistan when president bush determined that common article 3 would not apply to al-qaida or taleban detainees. common article 3  which reflects customary international law applicable to international and non-international conflicts  guarantees minimum standards of humane treatment and fair trial. on 6 september 2006  in lead-up to the fifth anniversary of the attacks of 11 september 2001 and with mid-term congressional elections looming  president bush sent his administrations draft of the military commissions act to congress. at the same time, he confirmed the existence of the cias secret detention program, which he said had been called into question by the hamdan ruling. he announced that 14 detainees had been transferred from the program  in which they had been held incommunicado for up to four and half years  to military custody in guantnamo. if congress passed the administrations bill, the president asserted, these 14 alleged leading members of al-qaida could face justice. congress passed an amended version of the act in late september. the new legislation further facilitates impunity. it narrows the scope of the us war crimes act by not expressly criminalizing acts that constitute outrages upon personal dignity, particularly humiliating and degrading treatment, prohibited under common article 3. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - opposing the military commissions act, arguing that it places the usa squarely on the wrong side of international law, and calling on the usa","","",1,FALSE

october 2003 usa (virginia)   lee boyd malvo, a.k.a. john lee malvo (m), black, jamaican national, aged 18 at a trial scheduled to begin on 10 november in the commonwealth of virginia, the prosecution is intending to seek a death sentence against lee boyd malvo for a murder he is alleged to have committed when he was 17 years old. international law, binding on all countries, prohibits the use of the death penalty against child offenders  defendants who were under 18 at the time of the crime. john allen muhammad, aged 42, and lee boyd malvo are charged in 10 sniper killings that occurred over a three-week period in october 2002 in virginia, maryland and washington dc. at lee malvos forthcoming trial, the teenager will be tried for the murder of linda franklin who was shot dead in fairfax county, virginia, on 14 october 2002. john muhammad has not yet been brought to trial. following the arrests of the two suspects, us attorney general john ashcroft announced that he had ordered federal agents to transfer lee malvo from federal custody to the local authorities in fairfax county, virginia. he said that his decision was based on a number of considerations, including that the first prosecutions should occur in those jurisdictions that provide the best law and the best range of available penalties. he added that it was imperative that the death penalty be an option. neither federal nor maryland law provides for the death penalty for those under 18 at the time of the crime, but virginia law does. virginia is known for the relative speed at which it takes capital defendants from conviction to execution, and has executed three child offenders since 1998. lee malvos trial, which is expected to last for more than a month, will be held in the city of chesapeake after the judge granted a defence motion for a change of venue from fairfax county. the charges against lee malvo include murder in the commission of an act of terrorism, and his defence lawyers argued that under this theory all residents of fairfax county (from whom the jury would be selected) were victims in this high-profile crime and would therefore not be impartial. the judge decided to transfer the trial to a jurisdiction out of the immediate area where many citizens lived in fear during the month of october 2002 as a result of the crimes with which the defendant is charged. last month, the judge denied a motion in which the defence sought to have the death penalty excluded from the case in line with international law. in an editorial, the washington post wrote: [w]hatever one thinks of capital punishment, it ought not be applied to children, whose personalities and capacities for judgment are not yet fully formed. government takes on, in general, a protective role with respect to children... it is an abdication of that protective role for state governments, even in prosecuting terrible crimes, to respond to youth crime by seeking execution. to sentence someone to die for a crime committed as a child, one has to believe that  in the long natural life the defendant would otherwise have before him  meaningful change and some measure of redemption are either impossible or unimportant. there are good reasons why the rest of the world has rejected executions of children. the paper described such use of the death penalty as an abhorrent policy. background information the imposition of the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime is prohibited by international law, and has been roundly condemned by united nations bodies and experts. the geneva conventions, the international covenant on civil and political rights, the convention on the rights of the child, the american convention on human rights and the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, all have provisions exempting this age group from execution. in october 2002, the inter-american commission on human rights concluded:  the acceptance of this norm crosses political and ideological boundaries and efforts to detract from this standard have been vigorously condemned by members of the international community [t]his proscription binds the community of states, including the united states. since 1990, the usa has executed 19 child offenders, compared to 14 such executions reported in the rest of the world combined. these 14 occurred in democratic republic of congo, iran, nigeria, pakistan, saudi arabia, and yemen. yemen and pakistan have now abolished such use of the death penalty in law. iran is reported to be considering such legislation. the usa is responsible for 13 of the 18 executions of child offenders known to have been carried out worldwide since january 1998, and for all four of such executions reported since january 2002. in october 2002, four of the nine us supreme court justices wrote that the execution of people for crimes committed when they were under 18 years old was ""a relic of the past and is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency in a civilized society. we should put an end to this shameful practice. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of linda franklin and the other nine victims of the sniper shootings, explaining that you are not seeking to minimize the gravity of these crimes or the suffering they have caused; - expressing deep concern, however, that fairfax county intends to pursue the death penalty against lee boyd malvo in the event of his conviction, in violation of a fundamental principle of international law respected around the world; - urging the commonwealths attorney (prosecutor) to offer human rights leadership

penalty / legal concern usa (virginia)  john yancey schmitt (m), aged 33 john schmitt, white, is scheduled to be executed in virginia on 9 november 2006. he was sentenced to death for the murder of a security guard during a bank robbery in 1999. he is seeking clemency on the grounds that the shooting was accidental and that he was denied a fair trial on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. earl shelton dunning was shot and killed at the bon air branch of nationsbank near richmond, virginia, on 17 february 1999. he died as a result of a gunshot wound to his chest. john schmitt was identified as the robber and on 19 february 1999, he was located in a hotel room in williamsburg, virginia. through a police negotiator, schmitt surrendered the next morning. before giving himself up, he admitted to robbing the bank and shooting shelton dunning. he maintained that the robbery had been to obtain money to purchase drugs (he had been addicted to cocaine and heroin for several years). he told the negotiator that he had never intended to kill anyone, and that the gun had gone off accidentally during a struggle with the guard. at the trial, the jury were told that john schmitt had robbed the same bank a month earlier (at which time the bank did not employ a security guard and no one had been injured during the robbery). after john schmitts arrest, but before his murder trial, the police arranged for his friend and former employer, cliff sauer, to secretly tape record any telephone conversations he had with schmitt from the jail. a conversation was recorded in which john schmitt described how he and the security guard had struggled over schmitts gun, and that it had gone off accidentally. he said that he had not intended to kill the guard, and expressed confidence that the banks security video recording would support his version of events. however, not only had none of the witnesses in the bank seen the shooting, but neither had it been captured on the banks surveillance camera. at the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, at which the only issue was whether the murder was premeditated, the judge did not allow either john schmitts statements to the police negotiator or his taped conversation with cliff sauer to be introduced by the defense. the state introduced expert evidence that the gun had been fired at shelton dunning at a distance of 12 to 36 inches. according to the clemency petition, there are two autopsy reports, the first dated 31 march 1999 and an amended version dated 23 june 1999. in the later version, references to soot found on shelton dunnings right sleeve and hand, which would be consistent with the gun having been fired at close range during a struggle, had been deleted. the defense lawyers had access to both autopsy reports, but did not cross-examine the medical examiner about the discrepancies. the jury convicted jothe state introduced expert evidence that the gun had been fired at shelton dunning at a distance

of john schmitts prior convictions for drug use, receipt of stolen property, commission of a crime in possession of a firearm, together with evidence of his violations of probation, and victim impact testimony from members of shelton dunnings family. the prosecution also introduced the taped conversation as evidence to support a finding of schmitts future dangerousness, an aggravating factor in virginia that makes a crime punishable by the death penalty. as well as containing schmitts claim that the shooting had been accidental, it also indicated a lack of remorse on schmitts part. studies have shown that a perceived lack of remorse in a defendant is a highly aggravating factor in the minds of us capital jurors. the jury sentenced john schmitt to death. after the case had moved into the federal appeals process, evidence of prosecutorial misconduct in relation to the secretly taped conversation came to light. specifically, the state had suppressed evidence that cliff sauer had received immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony, and that it had provided sauer, who was mentally unstable, with a free mental health evaluation. in proceedings before district judge robert payne, cliff sauer testified that he had cooperated with police and prosecutors because he was afraid that he might otherwise face charges, having brokered a deal for schmitt to buy a car using money stolen from the first bank robbery in january 1999. judge payne found that sauer had been told that the states purpose in having sauer tape conversations with schmitt was to obtain incriminating information about the february 1999 crime. the prosecutor used this evidence although schmitt had at the time of the recording already been assigned a lawyer, and despite neither the lawyer nor schmitt knowing of the secret taping. at the evidentiary hearing before judge payne, the prosecutor acknowledged that the taped evidence of schmitts lack of remorse was critical at the sentencing phase. judge payne himself described it as a ticket to the death chamber. he found that the evidence of sauers relationship to police and prosecutors could have been used to impeach sauers credibility, and had been suppressed, thus violating the us supreme courts 1963 ruling, brady v. maryland. judge payne held that the prosecutor suppressed evidence of obvious impeachment value moreover, when the prosecutor testified at the evidentiary hearing, he seemed to regard the whole concept of brady as a game. nevertheless, judge payne let the conviction and death sentence stand. upholding this ruling in july 2006, the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit said: we emphasize that the intentional suppression of impeachment material and other prosecutorial misconduct should not be taken lightly and we could not agree more with the district courts conclusion that this prosecution team displayed a disconcerting lack of respect for its sole responsibility to ensuupholding this ruling in july 2006, the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit said: we emphasize that the intentional suppression of impeachment material and other prosecutorial misconduct should not be taken lightly and we could not agree more with the district courts conclusion that this prosecution team displayed a disconcerting lack of respect for its sole responsibility to ensure that justice shall be done, as opposed to merely winning the case. the fourth circuit emphasized that the prosecutorial misconduct in the case was not confined to a single incident. under international law, anyone accused of a criminal offence has the right to the presumption of innocence, equality of arms (i.e. with neither party to a case put at a substantial disadvantage to the opposing party), and an effective defense. an essential element of the right to an effective defense, set out in article 14 of the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr), requires that the defendant be able ""to examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him"". in order to be able effectively to challenge any such witness, the defendant must be provided with any information known to the prosecution which may tend to impeach the witness credibility or reliability, including his or her relationship with the state authorities. furthermore international standards place a duty on the prosecution to uphold human rights; in particular, the un guidelines on the role of prosecutors require that prosecutors ""perform their duties fairlyand uphold human rights, thus contributing to ensuring due process and the smooth functioning of the criminal justice system"". the prosecutor failed to meet this standard in this case. virginia accounts for 97 of the 1,053 executions in the usa since executions resumed in 1977. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. today, 129 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. recommended action: please send appeals to

beatings with hoses and electrical cords, denial of food, clothing and basic necessities, and suffering on a scale difficult to imagine. mental health experts have linked this abuse with john muhammads brain dysfunction. background information state and federal officials were divided over where to first prosecute john muhammad and lee malvo, and which jurisdiction would be best placed to obtain and carry out the death penalty became a disturbing part of the decision-making process. despite the fact that the two suspects were arrested in maryland and most of the murders had happened there, the prosecutions were handed to virginia which, unlike maryland and the federal government, was and remains one of the most efficient executing jurisdictions in the usa, second only to texas in the number of executions carried out since 1977 and with a reputation for moving cases swiftly through the appeals system. on 7 november 2002, us attorney general john ashcroft, an ardent advocate of capital punishment, announced that virginia should conduct the initial prosecutions, emphasizing at a press conference that it was imperative that the ultimate sanction be available for those who have committed these crimes, even in the case of the teenaged malvo. the 2002 sniper shootings were undoubtedly traumatic for the individuals and communities affected by them. amnesty international does not seek to downplay the seriousness of these crimes or the suffering they have caused. it nevertheless opposes unconditionally the execution of john allen muhammad, as it does every execution, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or the culpability of the condemned. to end the death penalty is to abandon a destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly, to the public purse as well as in social and psychological terms. it has not been proven to have a special deterrent effect. it tends to be applied in a discriminatory way, on grounds of race and class. it denies the possibility of reconciliation and rehabilitation. it promotes simplistic responses to complex human problems, rather than pursuing explanations that could inform positive strategies. it prolongs the suffering of murder victims families, and extends that suffering to the loved ones of the condemned prisoner. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. today, some 139 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. international law is abolitionist in outlook, seeking to have retentionist countries narrow the applicability of the death penalty with a view to ending its use altogether. consistent with this, even those tried by international tribunals for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community - crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes - cannot be subjected to the death penalty. in july 2002, a year before john muhammad was sentenced to death, the rome statute of the international criminal court came into force. under article 77 of the statute, the maximum penalty which the court can impose is life imprisonment, subject to review after 25 years. lee malvo was also tried in virginia, and was sentenced in december 2003 to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, a sentence which violates international law in the case of an offender convicted for a crime committed when he or she was under 18 years old (see ua 288/03, 9 october 2003, and update, 24 december 2003). there have been 42 executions in the usa this year, bringing to 1,178 the total number of executions carried out there since judicial killing resumed in 1977. virginia accounts for 103 of these executions. see also, usa: the execution of mentally ill offenders, january 2006,","","",1,FALSE

northern colombia, are in grave danger. amnesty international has received reports that their names appear on a 'death list' compiled by army-backed paramilitaries. the lives of other members of the victims' movement in sucre department may also be at risk. members of the victims' movement became aware of the existence of the 'death list' in august 2006. amnesty international believes that those people named on the 'death list' may be individuals whom the paramilitaries fear could provide evidence against them in criminal proceedings, as well as those campaigning for their right to truth, justice and reparation in cases of human rights violations. one member of the victims' movement, luis guevara, was reportedly killed by paramilitaries on 22 august 2006 in the coveas area of the municipality of san onofre, department of sucre. in the past, human rights defenders and others campaigning for justice in cases of human rights violations committed by the security forces or their paramilitary allies have repeatedly been the target of human rights violations themselves. according to information received, nine people with alleged links to paramilitary structures operating in the north of colombia whose names appeared on the 'death list' have already been killed. criminal investigation authorities recently discovered a computer owned by a paramilitary leader, containing documents highlighting close links between paramilitaries and local political leaders, which could potentially incriminate both paramilitaries and political leaders in cases of human rights violations and other crimes. amnesty international fears that paramilitaries and their allies will take all possible action to prevent serious investigation into the evidence found on the computer. in this context, efforts by the victims' movement to denounce links between paramilitary structures and local politicians, denounce the re-emergence of paramilitary structures in the region, and demand that full criminal investigations are carried out into human rights violations committed by paramilitaries and their supporters, may place its members at increased risk. the victims' movement is a non-governmental organization which campaigns for the surviving relatives of all those killed by the army or their paramilitary allies in the four-decade long armed conflict in colombia. it is reported that the 'death list appeared soon after the victims movement held a demonstration in opposition to the re-arming of paramilitaries in sucre, on 26 august 2006.   the organization's subsequent decision to present a report to the senate, in october 2006, in which they name local and national politicians with clear links to restructured paramilitary groups, has further heightened concerns for their members safety. the report condemns the emergence of these restructured paramilitary groups in sucre which are going under the names of black eagles (guilas negras), and the new generation,(la nueva generacion). it also draws attention to the presence of nearly 200 demobilized paramilitary members of the new generation operating in rural areas of the municipality of san onofre, department of sucre, and neighboring areas, who have claimed to be planning to regain control of san onofre within a month and of the whole of sucre by december 2006. in light of this information, the victims' movement is calling for the senates commission on human rights to visit san onofre on 27 november. background information colombia's army-backed paramilitary groups have supposedly been demobilizing in a government-sponsored process. despite this, amnesty international has continued to receive reports of human rights violations committed by paramilitary groups operating in coordination with the security forces. it appears that many paramilitary groups have not demobilized at all, but are continuing to operate, often under new names. using new names for these groups appears to be part of a strategy to cover up the fact that paramilitary structures have not actually demobilized. recent public statements made by paramilitary organizations acknowledge that their military structures remain intact. amnesty international is concerned that the overall legal framework for the demobilization of illegal armed groups, including the justice and peace law, still fails to conform to international human rights standards on the right to truth, justice and reparation, and exacerbates colombias endemic problem of impunity. impunity remains a major obstacle in colombia. perpetrators of human rights violations know that they will not be brought to justice, even when strong evidence against them exists. human rights defenders and others who threaten this impunity are frequently the target of human rights violations to silence them. their continued presence in communities sends a clear signal that demanding justice and respect for human rights will be a difficult and often dangerous struggle. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - calling on the authorities to take effective action to protect those named above,

- urging the authorities to conduct a full and impartial investigation into his beating, and to bring those found responsible for either conducting or sanctioning the attack to justice; - reminding the authorities that the un declaration on the rights and responsibilities of individuals, groups and institutions to promote and protect universally recognized human rights and fundamental liberties recognizes the legitimacy of the activities of human rights defenders and their right to carry out their activities without any restrictions or fear of reprisals;

death penalty usa (texas)     robert jean hudson (m), black, aged 45 robert hudson is scheduled to be executed in texas on 20 november. he was sentenced to death in 2000 for the murder of his former girlfriend edith kendrick. according to the states evidence at trial, robert hudson telephoned edith kendrick at her apartment in dallas on the evening of 6 may 1999. he became upset on hearing a mans voice in the background, went to the apartment, and kicked the door open. when edith kendrick attempted to intervene between hudson and the man in the apartment, robert hudson threatened her with a knife. the other man ran out to call the police. edith kendricks eight-year-old son sustained serious cuts when he came between his mother and hudson, and fled. when edith kendrick attempted to flee, she was stabbed repeatedly. police arrived quickly and found robert hudson in a nearby shop. he subsequently signed a written statement admitting to stabbing edith kendrick. he was charged, and his trial began on 28 february 2000. the defense called no witnesses at either the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, or the subsequent sentencing phase, at which the jury sentenced him to death, on 1 march 2000. four of hudsons relatives have signed affidavits that they would have been willing to testify on his behalf at the trial, but that they had never been called by the defense. they have said that they could have testified not only to hudsons good character, but to his difficult family background and his childhood problems with anger management for which he was prescribed medication from an early age. the appeal courts have dismissed the claim that hudsons trial representation was inadequate. at the federal level, a district court dismissed his appeal in 2007. upholding the death sentence in april 2008, the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit concluded that on balance, we cannot say that a reasonable jurist would find debatable or wrong the district courts conclusion that hudson failed to show prejudice from counsels failure to investigate his four family members and to discover and present their mitigating evidence. up to and during his trial in 2000, hudson was prescribed anti-depressant medication. shortly before the trial began he was administered a number of different drugs, all of which can cause drowsiness, dizziness, confusion and fatigue. robert hudson has stated in an affidavit that he had trouble staying awake during the trial. in its 2008 ruling, however, the fifth circuit court of appeals rejected the argument that he had been forcibly medicated or that the administration of the drugs had adversely affected his competency to stand trial. the clemency petition filed on behalf of robert hudson states that in spite of his troubled background and the circumstances of his trial, mr hudson has never denied responsibility for the death of edith kendrick, nor claimed that his conduct was, in any way, excusable. to the contrary, he freely admitted his guilt prior to receiving any legal advice. however, the circumstances of his life should have been heard by a jury of his peers prior to their decision to terminate his life. that this did not occur was not his fault and casts doubt on the fairness of our judicial system. the clemency petition urges the board of pardons and paroles to recommend that the governor commute robert hudsons death sentence to life imprisonment. background information texas continues to account for a large number of the usas executions. of the 1,129 people put to death nationwide since 1977 when executions resumed in the usa, 418 were in texas. there have been 30 executions in the usa this year, 14 of them in texas. robert hudson is one of six inmates facing execution in texas before the end of november. since governor rick perry took office in 2001, 180 prisoners have been put to death in texas. virginia accounts for the next highest number of executions in the usa, with 102 executions in the past 30 years. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. to end the death penalty is to abandon a destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly, to the public purse as well as in social and psychological terms. it has not been proved to have a special deterrent effect. it tends to be applied in a discriminatory way, on grounds of race and class. it denies the possibility of reconciliation and rehabilitation. it promotes simplistic responses to complex human problems, rather than pursuing explanations that could inform positive strategies. it prolongs the suffering of the murder victims family, and extends that suffering to the loved ones of the condemned prisoner. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. it is a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. it is an affront to human dignity. it should be abolished. today, some 137 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in 2007, the un general assembly called for a moratorium on executions worldwide and for retentionist countries to work towards abolition. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible (please include robert hudsons prisoner number,

   24 november 2004 usa (north carolina)    charles anthony walker (m), black, aged 39 charles walker is scheduled to be executed in north carolina on 3 december 2004. he was convicted in 1995 of the first degree murder of tito davidson in 1992. charles walker, who has a history of mental illness, was convicted on the basis of testimony of accomplices, none of whom was subjected to a capital trial. the jury which sentenced him to death did so despite finding that he had not actually killed tito davidson, whose body was never found. several of the jurors now support clemency. tito davidson went missing on 11 august 1992, and is believed to have been murdered the next day at pamela haizlips apartment in the town of greensboro. on 13 august, police received an anonymous tip that there was a body in a rubbish bin at the apartment block, but none was found. a month s search through 10,000 tons of landfill refuse that included the contents of such bins collected between 11 and 17 august 1992 also revealed no dead body. after antonio wrenn, a suspect in an unrelated case, told police about some firearms that he claimed had been used in an unsolved murder in which the body had been thrown into a rubbish bin, the police began building a case based on statements of the alleged participants in tito davidsons suspected murder. rahshar darden, pamela haizlip, jesse thompson, charles walker and antonio wrenn were arrested and charged with first degree murder. rahshar darden pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was released in 2001 after serving six years in prison. jesse thompson accepted a second-degree murder plea and is now eligible for parole. antonio wrenn pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder and served seven years in prison. pamela haizlip made a similar plea and was sentenced to time already served (two years). the state offered charles walker a second-degree murder plea, but he refused it, maintaining his innocence and firing his lawyer who had urged him to accept the plea. the lawyer has said that he puts this reaction down to charles walkers mental problems. after walker rejected the plea bargain, the case then automatically proceeded as a capital case, which would not have happened under todays state law. the state presented no physical evidence of any kind that linked charles walker to the murder: no fingerprints, no blood evidence, no autopsy, no dna evidence, and no ballistics evidence. indeed, there was no physical evidence of a murder, and no confession from the defendant. all the evidence against walker came from the inconsistent testimony of witnesses who were themselves implicated in some way in the crime. rahshar darden, the only person who claimed to have seen tito davidson killed, testified that he and jesse thompson had repeatedly shot davidson and slashed his throat. he claimed that davidson was still alive when charles walker came in and killed him with a single shot. however, other testimony, provided by antonio wrenns girlfriend, indicated that darden and thompson had said after the murder that darden had shot davidson four times in the chest and once between the eyes, and that thompson had fired the last, fatal shot into davidsons chest. pamela haizlip also testified that thompson had admitted to her that he and darden had killed davidson. the jurors clearly found it difficult to reach a verdict, taking two days to find walker guilty. at the sentencing, the jury was not provided with a full picture of the man they were being urged to pass a death sentence against. the jury heard some evidence that he suffered from mental illness, bipolar disorder with paranoid features. this was consistent with the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia that he had received as a child, a mental illness which after his initial hospitalizations had remained untreated from the age of 12 when he lived on the streets of new york. the jurors were not presented with the records documenting this childhood mental illness, however. in 1982, aged 17, living in an abandoned building, he shot a man who he thought was following him with malicious intent. he was sent to prison with a recommendation of psychiatric treatment. he was released after six years without receiving the treatment. eighteen months later his parole was revoked and he was sent back to prison for another year, before being paroled again in august 1991. he has spent all but about two years of his adult life in prison. he has been prescribed anti-psychotic and other medication on death row. the jury did not hear substantial available evidence of charles walkers early childhood abuse at the hands of his parents or their history of mental illness. his cousin has since recalled the physical abuse to which charles was subjected as a young boy by his mother, including being whipped in the face with a belt, whippings with electrical cords, and being burned with a steam iron. his mother was addicted to cocaine, and he was exposed to her drug usage from an early age. at the age of five, he witnessed her being stabbed almost to death by one of her boyfriends in their home. the jury deliberated for four days before recommending a death sentence. on their sentencing form, the jurors answered no to the question of whether charles walker had fired the fatal shot. instead they found that he had intended to kill the victim while acting with others. several of the jurors have recently said that they believe that the death sentence should be commuted to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, an option that was not available to them at the time of the trial. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. the death penalty is an affront to human dignity and a symptom of a culture of violence. in addition, the capital justice system in the usa is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. since 1973, 117 people have been released
