(even if true, these allegations would not eliminte possible concerns about her return to iran nor us treaty obligations to avoid sending her to a country which might torture her.)  our organization believes that while ms. samadi seeks to prevent refoulement, that is, as she challenges us attempts to withdraw her refugee status and deport her to iran, us officials must afford her the same rights due other asylum-seekers.   international standards suggest that the detention of asylum seekers should normally be avoided, and imposed only under particular circumstances.  even if they must be detained, asylum-seekers should not be held in jails designed for criminal offenders.  it is clearly abusive of international standards to hold a person declared to be a refugee in a jail and in a location so far from her legal counsel. the reports to amnesty international that detention space is readily available near washington, dc suggest that the ins may be acting in an arbitrary and punitive manner towards ms. samadi, thus futher violating her rights to effectively seek durable protection from persecution.  if she is a victim of torture, it is possible that us actions are adding to the results of the trauma she has already experienced. suggested action: please write commissioner doris meissner expressing concern about the detention and treatment of ms. samadi.   ask why she is being held in jail given her refugee status, and why she is being held so far from legal counsel and a community of support given the reported availability of detention space near washington.  ask that her continued detention be evaluated in light of her status as an asylee and in light of international standards.

death penalty usa (texas)    250th texas execution looms richard william kutzner, aged 58 new name:      mack oran hill, aged 46 the execution of richard kutzner, scheduled to be the 250th in texas since the state resumed judicial killing in 1982, has been stayed. mack oran hill is now set to become the 250th prisoner put to death in texas since 1982. late on 24 july, the texas court of criminal appeals blocked kutzners execution, due on 25 july, to allow consideration of his request to have dna testing conducted on newly-discovered physical evidence. richard kutzners lawyer claims that the evidence - hair and fingernail scrapings - was suppressed by the state at the 1997 trial. this is the first attempt by a texas death row prisoner to use a new state law, which went into effect on 5 april 2001, allowing inmates state-paid dna testing where such testing could affect the outcome of the case. kutzner was convicted in 1997 of the 1996 murder of kathryn harrison on the basis of circumstantial evidence. mack hill is due to be executed on 8 august for the 1987 murder of donald johnson, white. at the sentencing phase of the 1989 trial, psychiatric  expert dr james grigson testified that mack hill would be a future danger to society - a prerequisite for a death sentence in texas. dr grigson has testified for the state in over 140 capital trials, usually stating with 100 per cent certainty that the defendant would commit future acts of criminal violence if allowed to live. he was expelled from the american psychiatric association in 1995 for arriving at diagnoses without first having examined the individuals in question, and for indicating, while testifying in court as an expert witness, he could predict with 100% certainty that the individuals would engage in future violent acts. grigsons prediction of hills future dangerousness was not based on an examination of hill, but - as in many cases - on the basis of hypothetical questions posed by the prosecutor: dr grigson was asked for his assessment of the likelihood that the individual described in the hypothetical would be a continuing threat to society, inside or outside prison. in 1989, the year of mack hills trial, a judge on the court of criminal appeals wrote of the power of such expert testimony over impressionable jurors faced with the task of deciding between life and death: after having read many records of capital murder cases in which dr grigson testified..., i have concluded that, as a general proposition, when dr grigson speaks to a lay jury, or an uninformed jury, about a person who he characterizes as a severe sociopath, which a defendant who has been convicted of a capital murder always is in the eyes of dr grigson, the defendant should stop what he is then doing and commence writing out his last will and testament - because he will in all probability soon be ordered by the trial judge to suffer a premature death. a report compiled by an investigator for the dallas county district attorneys office - the kinne report, dated 29 july 1988 - showed that dr grigsons accuracy in predicting future violent behaviour by capital defendants approached zero percent. the report documented the conduct of 11 inmates whose death sentences were either commuted to a life sentence or reduced to a term of imprisonment. dr grigson testified for the state in 10 of these 11 cases. yet despite his near-identical predictions that each inmate would beyond any doubt, absolutely, and without any question commit acts of dangerousness in the future, the kinne report revealed that none of his predictions had been accurate. appeals to the courts that the state withheld the existence of the kinne report at mack hills trial, and thereby denied the defence an opportunity to impeach dr grigsons testimony, have been unsuccessful. claims that the state withheld evidence that two witnesses had been promised leniency by the prosecutor in return for their testimony, and that an audio tape of a conversation between the prosecutor and the lawyer of one of the witnesses had been altered, have also failed in the courts. according to reports, mack hill has been a model inmate. in a clemency petition, his lawyer wrote: mr hill has demonstrated through the past decade of his incarceration that he does not pose a future threat of violence within the prison system. texas accounts for more than a third of the 725 executions carried out in the usa since 2 july 1976, when the us supreme court lifted the moratorium on the death penalty which it had imposed four years earlier. a quarter of a century on, the us capital justice system is one marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error, as well as the inevitable dehumanization that defines this punishment wherever it occurs. on 2 july 2001, us supreme court justice sandra day oconnor said: after 20 years on the high court, i have to acknowledge that serious questions are being raised about whether the death penalty is being fairly administered in this country. last week texas senior state district judge c.c. cooke","","2001-07-16",5,TRUE

"113/13","mississippi execution blocked by state court the supreme court of mississippi granted willie manning a stay of execution on 7 may, about five hours before he was due to be put to death. he has been on death row for over 18 years; he was convicted in 1994 of two murders committed in 1992. tiffany miller and jon steckler, both students at mississippi state university, were murdered in oktibbeha county, in eastern mississippi, in the early hours of 11 december 1992. willie manning, 24 years old at the time of the crime, was brought to trial in late 1994 and sentenced to death. willie manning has consistently maintained his innocence of the murders. as his execution approached, lawyers for willie manning sought a stay of execution in order that dna and other forensic testing of evidence from the crime scene could be conducted. on 25 april, the mississippi supreme court denied the request, in a 5-4 decision. the majority concluded that the jury had been presented with conclusive, overwhelming evidence of guilt. the four judges in the minority said that not only should the testing be granted, but also the prosecutions jury selection tactics at the 1994 trial should be reviewed. the dissenting opinion stated that the reasons offered by the prosecution for dismissing certain african american prospective jurors (manning is black, the victims were white) were highly suggestive of being a cover for discriminatory motivation, and the facts suggest a pattern of impermissible racial discrimination by the prosecution. in a letter dated 2 may 2013, the us department of justice informed the district attorney of oktibbeha county that a review by the fbi and the department of justice had concluded that the microscopic hair comparison analysis testimony or laboratory report presented by an fbi expert at the manning trial had exceeded the limits of science and was, therefore, invalid. in a follow-up letter on 4 may, the department said that it had identified another error in the expert evidence presented in the manning case, namely that the expert had overstated the case for concluding that the hair had come from an african american. both letters stated the fbi was available to provide dna testing if the district attorney determines that further testing is appropriate or necessary. on 7 may, by a vote of eight to one, the mississippi supreme court granted a stay of execution pending further order of this court. the presiding judge was the only judge to object, asserting that manning has wholly and completely failed to comply with statutory requirements and the precedent of this court. judge michael randolph took issue with what he suggested was connectivity  between the department of justice and two organizations, the innocence project and the national association of criminal defense lawyers (nacdl) which the department said it had notified of the errors in the case. judge randolph seemed to reveal something of his own views relating to criminal justice issues when he pointedly said that the innocence project supports a moratorium on capital punishment and the nacdl has been an outspoken critic of the death penalty system. he added that i should not be surprised about the connectivity and expediency by which this review was accomplished as this is the same department of justice that grants and enforces miranda warnings [informing a suspect of his rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer] to foreign enemy combatants. no further action by the ua network is requested. many thanks to all who sent appeals. this is the first update of ua 113/13. further information:","update","2013-05-09",2,TRUE

that his ruling should not be misinterpreted as a finding that thomas provenzano is a normal human being without serious mental health problems, because he most certainly is not; and that if the burden were on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that provenzano is competent to be executed, the court would conclude that there is reasonable doubt. the court understands that this is not the standard, and that the state does not have the burden to prove anything. nevertheless, given the nature of the penalty, the court cannot help but be troubled by this fact. on 25 may 2000, the florida supreme court upheld the competency ruling. two of the seven judges dissented, saying: it is impossible to conclude in this case that provenzano has a rational understanding of the reason he is to be executed when we have a judicial finding based upon clear and convincing evidence that provenzano genuinely believes as a matter of fact that he really will be executed because he is jesus christ. the power of executive clemency exists to act as a safety net to catch those cases in which the courts have been unable, or unwilling, to provide a remedy. governor jeb bush has the authority to grant clemency on the advice of the board of executive clemency. he also has the power to grant reprieves of up to 60 days. background information at a florida house of representatives criminal justice and corrections council hearing in october 1999, representative howard futch suggested that because thomas provenzano believed he was jesus christ, the state should just crucify him. the legislator continued: id make him a cross, and we could take it out there to starke [death row] and nail him up. a subsequent editorial in a local newspaper described howard futchs comments as vicious, ill-judged and revealing. in his dim-witted way, futch has laid bare the truth of the death penalty in florida: its not about justice. its not about deterring crime. its about vengeance. in january 2000, the state legislature voted to adopt lethal injection as an alternative to the electric chair. legislators also voted for procedures to speed up death penalty appeals, despite growing concern about wrongful capital convictions in the usa (florida has released more wrongfully convicted capital inmates than any other state). the florida supreme court suspended the procedures in february to examine their legality, and in april, it ruled that they were an unconstitutional encroachment on the power of the court. it has made its own proposals for expediting appeals, which are currently the subject of consultation. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following as a guide: - acknowledging the seriousness of thomas provenzanos crime and the suffering of his victims and their families;

- expressing deep concern that two more prisoners - willis jay barnes and william prince davis - are scheduled for execution in texas; - noting with concern that these executions would be the 100th and 101st since the governor assumed office, and calling on him to grant both men 30-day reprieves and to urge the board of pardons and paroles to give serious consideration to clemency; - expressing deep concern that in its use of the death penalty, texas has violated and continues to violate international human rights standards, including those relating to child offenders and the mentally impaired;

it has not yet been possible to confirm that he wants amnesty international to take action on his behalf. in the video, the frente social por la paz have followed the usual technique of army-backed paramilitary groups, accusing those who campaign for justice in cases of human rights violations by the security forces and their paramilitary allies of being members or agents of the guerrilla forces, and thus legitimate targets for attack. on 16 may 2005, hollman morris and two other journalists, carlos lozano and daniel coronell, received death threats in the form of funeral wreaths. although the government has publicly condemned the threats against the three journalists and has since provided them with extra security, ai has no information as to whether the investigations into these threats have produced any results, yet the fact remains that those responsible have not been brought to justice. daniel coronell and his family have since left colombia to seek refuge in the united states. background information an internal conflict has raged in colombia over the last four decades between guerrilla forces and government security forces. the armed forces' counter-insurgency strategy has relied heavily on paramilitary groups to implement their dirty war tactics, which include torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions. their targets are supposedly guerrillas or suspected guerrillas, but they often apply this label to people such as trade unionists and human rights activists that they want to silence. guerrilla forces have intimidated or killed people they accuse of collaborating with their enemies, including human rights defenders, and have engaged in kidnapping and hostage-taking. in colombia journalists, human rights defenders, elected officials and election candidates are frequently threatened or killed. those campaigning for justice in cases of human rights violations committed by the security forces and their paramilitary allies have themselves frequently been threatened or killed by armed groups in colombias internal conflict, who accuse them of collaborating with their enemies. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing concern for the safety of hollman morris, javier giraldo moreno and gloria cuartas, who were reportedly identified as ""military targets"" in a video produced by the paramilitary group frente social por la paz;

http://www.amnesty-usa.org/urgact/ extra 146/99           death penalty / legal concern    20 october 1999 usa (missouri)  james w. chambers, white, aged 47 james chambers is scheduled to be executed in missouri on 10 november 1999 for the murder of jerry oestricker in arnold, near st louis, in may 1982. the two men had been arguing in a bar: they went outside when the owner asked them to stop or leave, and a few seconds later oestricker was shot dead. chambers was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in december 1982. the missouri supreme court reversed his conviction in 1984 because the trial court had failed to give the jury a self-defense instruction. he was retried in 1985 and again sentenced to death. this was overturned in 1990 by the 8th circuit court because he was ineffectively represented at trial. in 1991 he was retried and sentenced to death for a third time. under missouri law, the state supreme court must review each death sentence to determine if it is excessive in comparison to similar cases. according to james chamberss appeal lawyers, the seven cases cited by the court in its proportionality review of chamberss death sentence are entirely dissimilar to his. they include a murder of a man during a kidnapping, a double murder where the victims bodies were set on fire after they had been stabbed, and the stabbing of a store clerk during a robbery. when the state supreme court upheld chamberss second death sentence in 1986, one of its judges dissented: this is an ordinary barroom altercation... under these circumstances, i cannot impose the death penalty. the judge said that failure to reduce the sentence to one of imprisonment would render proportionality in missouri totally meaningless. dissenting in another case in 1992, one of the judges said that the court has continually refused to face up to its responsibilities in proportionality review. at all three trials the jury rejected the claim that james chambers had acted in self-defense, and accepted the prosecutions version that it was a premeditated attack. chamberss current lawyers argue that his trial attorneys failed to present vital witnesses to back up the self-defense claim or to effectively challenge the credibility of the prosecutions main witness, who gave inconsistent and contradictory accounts of what happened when the two men left the bar. they state that the defense also failed to present evidence showing that oestricker had attacked chambers with a pair of pliers during the incident, and that he had a reputation as a violent bar-room brawler. the foreman of the jury at the third trial has stated in an affidavit that he does not believe that chambers should be executed. he claims that the experienced and skilful prosecutor entirely out-performed the defense team, and believes that the jury would not have sentenced chambers to death if it had heard evidence of his mental limitations. a mental evaluation of chambers in 1982 found that he had suffered from depression for about two months prior to the shooting, and that he had an iq of 78, which places him in the borderline mental retardation range. he is reported to have spent time in five mental hospitals for evaluation and treatment during his lifetime. he suffered a serious head injury at the age of six, and is alleged to have been regularly beaten by his father. he was diagnosed as mildly retarded at the age of 14 and at 17 was found to suffer from mental retardation, borderline, with psycho-social environmental deprivation. in 1977 he was diagnosed as suffering from incipient paranoid schizophrenia. none of this evidence was presented to the jury who sentenced him to death at his third trial. this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. background information the death penalty in the usa is supposed to be reserved for the most aggravated murders. in reality, whether a defendant is sentenced to life or death can be strongly influenced by factors such as the quality of defense representation or the enthusiasm of the prosecuting authority in pursuing death sentences. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 580 prisoners have been put to death, including 80 this year, more than in any year since 1954. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity. each execution serves to perpetuate a culture of violence. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters in your own words, using the following as a guide: - explaining that you do not wish to belittle the seriousness of jerry oestrickers killing, but expressing concern that james chambers is facing execution for what a missouri supreme court judge has said would be a disproportionate punishment for an ordinary barroom altercation; - expressing concern that james chambers was sentenced to death on the basis of disputed eyewitness testimony, and by a jury which did not hear important evidence supporting his claim of self-defense or mitigating evidence about his mental impairment; - noting that the foreman of the jury has since stated his belief that the defense attorneys were not competent enough to match the prosecutor, and that had the jurors heard evidence of chamberss mental limitations they would not have sentenced him to death; - urging the governor to commute james chamberss

""i imagine that you members of the board have received letters from supporters, perhaps from around the united states, perhaps from around the world. the last time i appeared before this board was in conjunction with scotty moore's clemency hearing. i told you then i had a feeling that these letters were something more than expressions of direct concern for scotty moore. i told you that probably most of the people that wrote those letters wouldn't know scotty moore if they saw him. the aag then showed the board a copy of amnesty internationals urgent action for cornel cooks which he had obtained and read parts of it to the board to demonstrate what he considers to be a political action. ""what is evident is that most of these letters are more about a political viewpoint and the general opposition to the death penalty than they are about cornel cooks. don't misunderstand me, i think these people have a right to voice their opposition to the death penalty. but, this isn't the proper forum. this is where people who are intimately involved with this case come forward to tell you why or why not you should vote for clemency. in july, aag humes received the appellate award for outstanding advocacy in capital cases from the national association of government attorneys in capital litigation (see oklahoma shamelessly celebrates its violation of international law and deepens its isolation, amr 51/120/99, 2 august 1999). further recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters: - acknowledging the problem of violent crime, and expressing sympathy for the victims and their families; - pointing out that there are increasing numbers of such relatives in the usa who are speaking out against the death penalty, saying that executions do not ease their pain, and serve only to deepen a culture of violence; - expressing your own opposition to the death penalty, explaining that more than half the countries of the world have abandoned this punishment; - urging the governor to do all in his power to stop the execution of cornel cooks and all other death sentences that come before him. please do not mention aag humes comments relating to amnesty international at this stage. a separate response to these will be issued in due course. appeals to: the honorable frank keating governor of oklahoma, state capitol, room 212 oklahoma city, ok 73105","","1999-10-29",3,TRUE

perhaps, a measure of solace for some of those whove lost loved ones in terrible brutal ways. it is tempting to say their comfort is justification enough. but punishment meted out by the state must be more than a substitute for individual revenge. it is a measure of a societys moral code, of its regard for justice, mercy, and the rule of law. it is not from sympathy for the predators who have committed atrocities that the death penalty should be abolished, but from a profound aspiration to elevate society above the killers baseness and depravity. when the state kills in the name of justice, it makes murderers of those on whose behalf it acts. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - acknowledging the shocking crime of which andre graham was convicted and expressing sympathy for edward martin and the relatives of sheryl stack; - expressing concern at the imminent execution of andre graham, due to take place on the eve of international human rights day; - noting that andre graham, while admitting that he was present at the crime, has always denied that he was the triggerman; - expressing concern that this would be the 14th execution in virginia in 1999, more than in any year since the state resumed the death penalty; - noting that this directly contradicts the world trend to abolish the death penalty, with more than half of countries having stopped executions; - voicing opposition to the death penalty as a symptom of, not a solution to, the culture of violence; - urging the governor to commute the death sentence of andre graham as a first step towards abolishing this outdated punishment in virginia. appeals to: the honorable james gilmore governor of virginia state capitol richmond, va 23219","","",3,TRUE

there is no un-doing a sentence of death once it is carried out. bobby wilchers lawyer appealed to the us supreme court, presenting the justices with the question of whether the fifth circuit had been right to refuse to reinstate wilchers appeals due to the eleventh hour nature of the filing. half an hour before wilcher was due to be executed on 11 july, the supreme court order that the execution be delayed in order that it could consider the motion, and an hour later granted the stay to allow it to consider whether to take the case and consider the merits of the question raised. on 2 october, the us supreme court dismissed the appeal without comment. two days later, bobby wilcher signed another affidavit reiterating that he wished to take up his appeals. on 5 october, his lawyer filed an emergency motion in the district court seeking reinstatement of the appeals. on 14 october, the judge denied the motion. that ruling is now on appeal to the fifth circuit court of appeals and the case will again go to the us supreme court if the fifth circuit does not provide a remedy. background information over recent years, conditions on mississippis death row have been severely criticized, including in relation to the psychological impact of these conditions and the poor mental health care provided. in may 2003, a federal judge ruled that the conditions in the state penitentiary offended contemporary concepts of decency, human dignity and precepts of civilization which we profess to possess. judge jerry davis found that death row inmates were being subjected to profound isolation, intolerable stench and filth, consistent exposure to human excrement, dangerously high temperatures and humidity, insect infestations, deprivation of basic mental health care, and constant exposure to severely psychotic inmates in adjoining cells. among other things, the federal judge found that: the filthy conditions impacted on the mental health of inmates; the probability of heat-related illness was high for death row inmates, particularly those suffering from mental illness who either did not take appropriate steps to deal with the heat or whose medications interfere with the human bodys temperature regulation; the exposure to the severely psychotic individuals was intolerable; the mental health care provided to inmates was grossly inadequate; and the isolation of death row, combined with the conditions on it and the fact that its population are awaiting execution, would weaken even the strongest individual. in 2004, the us court of appeals agree[d] that the conditions of inadequate mental health care do present a risk of serious harm to the inmates' mental and physical health. again, the obvious and pervasive nature of these conditions supports the conclusion that [mississippi department of correction] officials displayed a deliberate indifference to these conditions. while the authorities have recently improved the environmental conditions on death row following the lawsuit brought against them, there has been an ongoing struggle to ensure adequate medical and mental health care. over the past decade, the un commission on human rights repeatedly adopted resolutions calling for an end to the use of the death penalty against anyone suffering from any form of mental disorder. scores of prisoners with histories of mental illness have been executed in the usa since 1977 (see ai report usa: the execution of mentally ill offenders,","update","",2,TRUE

(georgia)    carl isaacs carl isaacs (m), white, aged 49, is scheduled to be executed on 6 may 2003 in georgia. the crime for which he is set to die took place 30 years ago when he was 19 years old. he is now 49, having already served the equivalent of a life sentence. on 14 may 1973, six members of the same family were murdered near their mobile home in seminole county in the rural southwest corner of georgia: jerry alday aged 35, ned alday aged 62, jimmy alday aged 25, mary alday aged 26, chester alday aged 32 and aubrey alday aged 57. mary alday was also raped. four people were tried for the crime in 1974: carl isaacs, his 15-year-old brother billy isaacs, his half-brother wayne coleman aged 25, and a friend george dungee aged 34. the three adult defendants were sentenced to death. their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1985 on the grounds that pre-trial publicity had prejudiced the fairness of their seminole county trial. at a retrial in another county in 1988, carl isaacs was again sentenced to death and he has been on death row ever since. according to the states case, carl isaacs shot jerry, ned, jimmy and aubrey alday. wayne coleman and george dungee were resentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. they are still in prison. according to the state's case, wayne coleman killed chester alday and also shot ned alday, while mary alday, who was allegedly raped by wayne coleman and carl isaacs, was killed by george dungee. billy isaacs served 19 years before being released. carl isaacs was diagnosed with cancer in recent years, and had to have his bladder removed. background information since carl isaacs was first sentenced to death in 1974, more than 60 countries have abolished the death penalty in law. today, 112 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in 1972, in furman v georgia , the us supreme court overturned the usas capital laws because of the arbitrary way in which the death penalty was being handed out, and there was hope that the usa might move toward abolition. however, the supreme court did not find the death penalty to be unconstitutional per se , and state legislatures quickly set about rewriting their capital laws to take account of the furman ruling. in gregg v georgia in 1976, in a decision that would place the usa squarely on the wrong side of history in relation to the death penalty, the supreme court approved the new capital laws. executions resumed in the usa with the execution of gary gilmore in utah in january 1977. since then, more than 840 men and women have been put to death in 32 states and at the federal level. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, every execution a symptom of, rather than a solution to, a culture of violence. the death penalty has not been shown to have a unique deterrent effect, carries the risk of irrevocable error, and extends the suffering of one family  that of the murder victim  to another  the loved ones of the condemned. in effect, the death penalty for murder imitates and takes to new heights of calculation what it seeks to condemn, the deliberate taking of human life. the death penalty in the usa is arbitrary, discriminatory, and inevitably cruel. who is sentenced to death is influenced not only by the crime itself, but issues such as race or status of the murder victim or the defendant, where the crime is committed, the quality of legal representation and political considerations. the us capital justice system is characterised by error, both in terms of convictions and sentencing. more than 100 people have been released from death rows since 1973 after evidence of their innocence emerged. a landmark study published in 2000, and covering a 23-year period, found that the error rate in capital cases was 68 per cent. in other words, in almost seven out of every 10 cases, appeal courts had found that the conviction or sentence should not stand. inadequate legal representation and prosecutorial or police misconduct were the main errors. the study expressed grave doubts that the courts were finding all such errors. support for a moratorium on executions has grown over recent years in the usa as the evidence of the unreliability and unfairness of the death penalty system has mounted. however, most politicians have failed to offer human rights leadership, preferring to defer to perceived public support for judicial killing. their failure of leadership has left the usa increasingly isolated on this fundamental issue, and given the lie to the usas self-proclaimed status as the worlds most progressive force for human rights. as of 30 april 2003, there had been 849 executions in the usa since 1977, including 29 in 2003. georgia has carried out 32 executions. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the surviving members and friends of the alday family and acknowledging the very serious nature of the crime for which carl isaacs was sentenced to death; - opposing the death penalty and calling for clemency for carl isaacs; - noting that carl isaacs was the only one of four defendants to receive a death sentence; - noting that carl isaacs, who was 19 at the time of the crime, has been under sentence of death for almost 30 years,

- urging the authorities to conduct a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into the death threats and other forms of intimidation directed towards dmitrii kraiukhin and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice in the course of proceedings that meet international standards of fairness;

- opposing the execution of robert knighton, and suggesting that clemency is a way to stop the cycle of violence and to begin to promote more constructive responses to violent crime; - applauding the opposition to the execution by family member sue norton, one of a growing number of relatives of murder victims in the usa who have recognized the futility and brutalizing nature of the death penalty; to the board: - calling on the board to recommend clemency for robert knighton; to the governor: - calling on the governor to accept such a recommendation or to issue a reprieve in the absence of one, in order that he can urge the board to reconsider in the interests of humanity and the reputation of the state of oklahoma;

(m) parisa was released on 5 december, after receiving 99 lashes. the supreme court had changed her sentence of execution by stoning to flogging after reviewing the case. in november, the supreme court rejected the sentence of stoning against shamameh ghorbani (known as malek). her case will be sent back to a lower court in the city of oromieh, west azerbaijan province, for a retrial. a man, abdollah f, is now known to be in prison under sentence of execution by stoning. there is no further information about the other women named above. parisa had been arrested in april 2004 after police in shiraz raided a brothel where she was working and arrested those present, including her husband. he had allegedly forced parisa into prostitution, as the family was poor and he was unemployed. during initial interrogations, parisa and her husband both confessed to a charge of adultery, but said that their family's poverty had forced them to do what they had done. during her trial at branch 5 of fars province criminal court, parisa retracted her confession of adultery. under iranian law, adultery can only be proved by the testimony of eyewitnesses (the number required varying for different types of adultery), a confession by the defendant (repeated four times), or the judge's ""knowledge"". parisa and her husband were convicted of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning on 21 june 2004. the sentence was upheld by branch 32 of the supreme court on 15 november 2005. parisas lawyer, an activist from the ""stop stoning forever"" campaign who is also representing her husband, lodged an objection against the stoning sentences with the discernment branch of the supreme court. on 8 november 2006, branch 15 of the supreme court reviewed the cases, to determine whether the sentence of stoning had been appropriate and consistent with islamic law. during the entire court session, parisa was holding the hands of her three-year-old son. on 27 november, the supreme court changed the sentence to flogging for both parisa and her husband. her husband has reportedly been sentenced to a period of being exiled to a different city. shamameh ghorbani (also known as malek) was sentenced to execution by stoning for adultery by a court in oromieh in june 2006. her brothers and husband reportedly murdered a man that they found in her house, and she too was nearly killed when they stabbed her. in november, it was reported that the supreme court had rejected her stoning sentence and ordered a retrial, citing incomplete investigations in the case. it is believed that shamameh ghorbani confessed to adultery in court, believing that this would protect her brothers and husband from prosecution for murder. under iranian law, a murder may not be punished if committed defending ones honor or that of relatives. in a letter to branch 12 of the criminal court, shamameh ghorbani is reported to have said, since i am a rural, illiterate woman and i didnt know the law, i thought that if i confessed to a relationship with the dead man, i could clear my brothers and husband of intentional murder. i said these untrue words in court and then understood i had done myself an injury. background information in mid-2006, a group of iranian human rights defenders, mostly women, among them activists, journalists and lawyers, began a campaign to abolish stoning, following reports that a man and a woman had been stoned to death in mashhad on 7 may 2006, despite an official moratorium on such executions. they identified at least nine women and two men under sentence of death by stoning, and lawyers in the group undertook to represent them. all nine of the women are subjects of uas. besides the women in this ua, they are ashraf kalhori (see ua 203/06, 27 july 2006 and follow-ups) and hajieh esmailvand (see ua 336/04, 16 december 2004 and follow-ups). on 9 december 2006, hajieh esmailvand was acquitted of the charge of adultery after a re-trial, and is now free. on 21 november 2006, the minister of justice, jamal karimi-rad, denied that stonings were being carried out in iran, a claim repeated on 8 december by the head of the prisons organization in tehran. the campaigners against stoning have since stated in response that there is irrefutable evidence that the mashhad stoning did indeed occur. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - welcoming the news that sentences of stoning against parisa and her husband najaf were overturned by the supreme court and that parisa has since been released; - stating that amnesty international considers the punishment of flogging to constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment amounting to torture, and expressing grave concern that parisa was flogged 99 times; - calling on the authorities to overturn the sentences of death by stoning that have been passed on the other seven people (naming them) immediately; - calling on the authorities to abolish the punishment of death by stoning. appeals to: leader of the islamic republic: his excellency ayatollah sayed ali khamenei the office of the supreme leader shoahada street qom, islamic republic of iran","update","",2,TRUE

"259/12","urgent action four men executed in iraq, two remain at risk additional information iraq is one of the world's leading executioners, as the government continues to battle against a high level of violence by armed groups. since the death penalty was reinstated in august 2004, at least 447 people have been executed. hundreds of prisoners are currently held on death row. many, probably the majority, of those sentenced to death have been convicted of violent crimes under the anti-terrorism law of 2005, including politically-motivated and sectarian bomb and other attacks that have killed and injured numerous civilians. many, however, were sentenced, and in some cases executed, after trials that, due to their unfairness, undermined rather than upheld justice. the death penalty has a long history in iraq. it was used extensively under saddam hussein as a tool of political repression. for a brief period, from the time of saddam husseins overthrow in march/april 2003, until the us-led coalition provisional authority handed power back to an iraqi interim government, use of the death penalty was suspended. at this time steps were already underway to bring saddam hussein and his associates to justice for crimes committed under their rule. by the time a special court, the supreme iraqi criminal tribunal (sict), had been established to try the men, iraq's interim government had already restored the death penalty and the sict (see below) was empowered to impose it. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as a violation of two fundamental human rights articulated in the universal declaration of human rights, the right to life (article 3) and the right not to be tortured or subjected to any other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (article 5) amnesty international considers the death penalty a violation of the right to life and the ultimate form of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. its irrevocability, combined with its capacity to be inflicted on the innocent due to the fallibility to which all criminal justice systems are subject, makes it an especially egregious punishment, while assertions of its crime deterrent effect are not borne out by scientific research and examination. in iraq, the death penalty has been increasingly used in recent years in circumstances that give added grounds for concern, as the united nations assistance mission for iraq (unami) pointed out in may 2012, when it expressed serious reservations about the integrity of the criminal justice system in iraq, including abuses of due process, convictions based on forced confessions, a weak judiciary, corruption and trial proceedings that fall short of international standards [] any miscarriage of involving capital punishment cannot be undone.

may 2003 usa (virginia)   percy levar walton (m), aged 24 percy walton, black, is scheduled to be executed in virginia on 28 may 2003. he was sentenced to death in 1997 for the murders of an elderly white couple, elizabeth hendrick, aged 81, and jesse hendrick, aged 80, and a 33-year-old black man, archie moore, in danville in november 1996. percy walton was 18 years and one month old at the time of the crime. there is evidence that he has suffered from schizophrenia, a serious mental illness, from the age of 16. percy waltons mental health had deteriorated during his mid-teens. having been clean, neat, polite, popular and well-behaved until then, he began to display dramatic changes in behavior. he stopped bathing, began to have difficulties controlling his emotions at home and school. he skipped school, stopped playing sports, became withdrawn, and began talking to himself. he laughed at inappropriate times, displayed irrational thought processes and between 1996 and 1997 his iq dropped from 90 to 77. after his arrest in november 1996, percy walton displayed signs of possible mental illness. in telephone calls to his family, he insisted that his mother was his sister, and referred to his father as his brother, his grandfather as his father and his grandmother as his mother. he said he had discovered that he had two brothers, when he has none. he told his mother he was the queen bee, and his grandmother that he was superman. he told relatives that he was jesus christ, and that he was a millionaire. he insisted that he would come back to life as soon as he was executed, and that he would retrieve and bring back alive his grandfather who had recently died. in pre-trial custody, his lawyer noted waltons unusual behavior. in february 1997, for example, percy walton claimed to be percy gunn (walton s father) and also the king of hearts. during a subsequent meeting, walton told his lawyer that if he closed his eyes he could not be seen. he remained convinced that he would be released on bail despite his lawyer stating that this would not happen. walton demanded a speedy trial at which his innocence would be proven. by july, however, he was saying that he wanted to plead guilty because the [electric] chair is for killers. in a 1999 affidavit, the trial lawyer recalled how percy walton did not meaningfully assist us in preparing a defense. often times it was extremely difficult to communicate with mr walton, and there were occasions when we could not tell whether he understood what we were saying to him. other times it was clear from mr waltons questions and responses to my questions that mr walton understood little of what i was telling him. the lawyer recalled that we were unable to convince mr walton that he would not come back to life if he was executed. in july, a court-appointed psychologist wrote that waltons articulation of his thoughts was incomprehensible. he recommended that walton be placed in a secure psychiatric hospital on the grounds that he was a danger to himself and others. the trial court rejected this. in a 2001 affidavit, the psychologist wrote that the symptoms that walton displayed in july 1997 were  consistent with forms of schizophrenia, but that he had not been able to make such a diagnosis without further evaluation. he stated that it was and remains his opinion that at that time percy walton was not competent to stand trial. however, he was not called to testify to that effect after the court ordered a psychiatrist at the state hospital to conduct an assessment. this psychiatrist determined that walton was competent. in september 1997 percy walton told his lawyer that he wanted to plead not guilty and have a jury trial because he was innocent. days later, he reverted to admitting guilt again. at end of that month, asked whether he would plead guilty or not guilty, he refused to speak, but responded by writing the word chair on a piece of paper. he told his attorneys that he wanted to be executed in order to come back to life so he could be with his honeys. in court in october 1997, percy walton pleaded guilty to the murders and the judge accepted the plea. the proceedings then moved into a sentencing phase. during the hearing, percy walton laughed, smiled and waved to family members. he even laughed during the victim impact testimony of one of the hendricks granddaughters. after a recess on the second day of the hearing, percy walton refused to come back into the courtroom because he had been  disrespected. he was sprayed with mace and brought back into the courtroom in shackles. percy waltons state-appointed lawyer chose not to offer a mental health defense against the death penalty, and instead offered evidence that his client was a young man who was usually polite, quiet and respectful, and who had taken responsibility for the three murders. the judge passed three death sentences against walton. in 1999, a psychiatrist, a neuropsychologist and a neurologist assessed percy waltons mental health for his appeals. in their opinion, he suffers from severe chronic schizophrenia and was probably suffering from this mental illness at the time of the crime. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. today, 112 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in repeated resolutions, the united nations commission on human rights has called on all retentionist countries not to impose or carry out the death penalty against anyone with any form of mental disorder. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, it has put more than 850 men and women to death. virginia is ranked second in the number of executions carried out, having killed 88 prisoners. in 1999, virginias then governor, james gilmore, commuted the death sentence of calvin swann on grounds of his schizophrenia from which he had suffered since his late teens. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the relatives of elizabeth and jesse hendrick and of archie moore, explaining that you are not seeking to minimize the suffering their deaths will have caused; - opposing the execution of percy levar walton; - expressing concern at evidence that he was suffering from serious mental illness at the time of the crime and the trial, and that the sentencing judge was not presented with any mental health evidence in mitigation; - noting that post-conviction expert assessment has diagnosed him as suffering from schizophrenia; - pointing to the repeated resolutions at the un commission on human rights against the use of the death penalty against people suffering from mental illness, praising governor james gilmores decision to commute the death sentence of calvin swann because of the prisoners schizophrenia; - calling for clemency for percy walton in the interest of decency and the reputation of

their exceptional character must be preserved. article 49 of the fourth geneva convention states that ""individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive."" even though the west bank and gaza strip are both part of the occupied territories under israels control, they are geographically separate and the israeli army does not allow palestinians living in the gaza strip access to the west bank and vice-versa. hence, the forcible transfer of palestinians from the west bank to the gaza strip also contradicts the spirit of article 49. the israeli authorities have contended that the forcible transfer of palestinians from the west bank to the gaza strip is a lesser measure than imprisonment. however, for palestinians being expelled from their home towns brings back painful memories of the mass expulsion and forced flight of hundreds of thousands of palestinians from their towns and villages at the time of the establishment of the state of israel in 1948 and again at the time of israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip in 1967. forcible transfer to the gaza strip is particularly evocative, as more than 83% of the gaza strips population are palestinian refugees from the 1948 and 1967 wars. israel has the right to take measures to protect the security of its citizens, but such measures must be reasonable, necessary and proportionate, and must comply with international law. if the authorities believe that these 18 detainees pose a threat to israels security, their forcible transfer to the gaza strip does not in any way constitute a preventive or protective measure  as they could easily engage in activities against israel in the gaza strip. the israeli authorities have repeatedly accused the palestinian authority (pa) of failing to arrest people involved in attacks against israelis who reside in areas under pa jurisdiction and notably in the gaza strip. it is difficult to see how, forcibly transferring people, whom israel considers to be potentially dangerous for its security, to the gaza strip can effectively remove or reduce the security danger they allegedly pose to israels security. amnesty international believes that the israeli authorities are using forcible transfer as a form of collective punishment, a violation of article 33 of the fourth geneva convention, and a grave violation of one of the most basic principles of international human rights law - notably the right of any accused to a fair trial and to challenge any evidence used against them. the israeli authorities claim that these administrative detainees, like thousands of others who have also been detained without charge or trial, are a danger to israels security. the organization believes that the above-named 18 and anyone else suspected of a recognizably criminal offence should be promptly charged and brought to trial in accordance with international standards for fair trial, and that the israeli authorities failure to produce the necessary evidence to prosecute and convict suspects in a court of law should not result in a situation where people are punished for the actions of others or as a deterrent to others many thanks to all those who sent appeals. if possible, please send a final round of appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - condemning the unlawful forcible transfer of the 18 administrative detainees named above; - calling for the annulment of the military order for the unlawful forcible transfer of the above-mentioned 18 and for them to be allowed to return to the west bank; - urging the israeli authorities to comply with article 33 and other relevant provisions of the fourth geneva convention, which israel has ratified and which states that no protected person (palestinians living in the occupied territories are protected persons under the terms of the convention) may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed; - pointing out that if the above named eighteen have committed any offence they should be promptly charged and brought to trial in accordance with international standards for fair trial. if the authorities have no intention of bringing them to justice for any recognizably criminal offences they should not be subjected to forcible transfer, administrative detention or other punishment. appeals to: ministry of justice: minister of justice yosef lapid 29 salah al-din street jerusalem 91010, israel","update","2003-10-15",4,TRUE

adequate mental health services may have spared colburn years of suffering and might have spared his victim's life. it is no secret that texas has inadequate resources for helping the mentally ill lead normal lives. looked at another way, it would be better for all and a service to justice if such serious mental health issues were addressed before there is any need to deal with them within the criminal justice system and on death row."" the us supreme court stopped james colburns execution shortly before it was due to be carried out on 6 november 2002. however, on 21 january 2003, it announced that it was refusing to take his appeal, which had raised questions surrounding his current competency to be executed. repeated resolutions in recent years at the united nations commission on human rights have called on retentionist countries not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person. there have been 12 executions in the usa this year, eight of them in texas. texas now accounts for 297 of the 832 executions carried out nationwide since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977. for more information see: texas: in a world of its own as 300th execution looms (amr 51/101/2003, 23 january 2003). also see: usa: james colburn: mentally ill man scheduled for execution in texas (amr 51/158/2002, october 2002). recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the friends and family of peggy murphy; - noting that james colburn has long suffered from schizophrenia, for which he struggled to get appropriate treatment because he lacked medical insurance, and noting evidence that he was suffering from his illness at the time of the crime, and that he may have been incompetent to stand trial; - noting the repeated resolutions at the united nations calling for the death penalty not to be used against the mentally ill; - calling for clemency for james colburn in the interest of decency and the reputation of texas. appeals to: ( in your appeals, please quote james colburns death row","update","2002-10-03",2,TRUE

execution after being sentenced to qesas (retribution in kind) for the murder of hajieh esmailvands husband. ruhollah g has been flogged for unmarried sexual relations. his execution has not been implemented because he is trying to obtain the consent of the murder victims relatives to forgive him and to accept the payment of diyeh (blood money). some of the relatives of the murder victim are under 18-years-old, at which point they can decide whether to accept the payment. he has been detained in jolfa prison since his arrest in 1999. news reports in 2004 had suggested that hajieh esmailvand was sentenced for having an adulterous relationship with a 17-year-old boy, ruhollah g, and that both had been accused of murdering hajieh esmailvands husband. it is now known that in 1999, hajieh esmailvand defended herself from a rape attempt at her home by a 20-year-old man known to her husband. this is now believed to be the person named in 2004 press reports as 17-year-old ruhollah g. six months later, while hajieh esmailvand and her children were staying with her parents in tabriz for her childs medical treatment, the man killed her husband during a fight. during the investigation, the man accused hajieh esmailvand of being his accomplice and said they had been having an extra-marital affair. hajieh esmailvand was arrested on 20 january 2000. hajieh esmailvand's mother tongue is azerbaijani turkic, and she is from a mainly   iranian azerbaijani area of iran. she had a court-appointed lawyer during her trial. the court proceedings against her were conducted in persian, which she could not fully understand or speak at the time. during her trial she explained that the alleged murderer had attempted to rape her once, but it is believed that her statements were misunderstood as a confession to having committed adultery. she did not know the persian word for adultery. on 25 april 2000, branch 3 of jolfa public court sentenced hajieh esmailvand to five years' imprisonment, to be followed by execution by hanging. the supreme court reportedly upheld her death sentence, but changed the method of execution from hanging to stoning. hajieh esmailvand has said that she did not know she had been sentenced to stoning until she asked her brother some time later, because she did not know the persian word for stoning. she wrote several letters to the head of the judiciary, the last dated 1 june 2004, asking for a reprieve and insisting that she was innocent and had never committed adultery. the stoning was scheduled for 1 september 2004 at the prison in jolfa. according to reports, leaflets were published and distributed in jolfa by the local judiciary, inviting the public to participate. however, the judge responsible for implementing the sentence found flaws in the case. the judge reportedly objected to the sentence because hajieh esmailvand did not know the meaning of the word adultery and had repeatedly denied having had sexual intercourse or committing adultery. in addition, her confessions did not amount to adultery since she had feared and fought off the man, and the trial judge did not properly explain the basis on which he issued the stoning sentence. around 21 december 2004, a stay of execution was granted by the head of the judiciary, ayatollah shahroudi. the case was reportedly referred to the amnesty and clemency commission for decision, while hajieh esmailvand remained detained in jolfa prison for nearly two years, waiting for a decision on her case. in mid-2006, a group of mostly women human rights defenders (hrds) in iran, including activists, journalists and lawyers, began a campaign to abolish stoning. they identified at least 9 women and 2 men who have been sentenced to death by stoning, and lawyers in the group took up representation of these cases, including of hajieh esmailvand. in september 2006, the supreme court rejected hajieh esmailvands stoning sentence, and she was released on bail of 100 million toman (around us$100,000) pending her re-trial. by that time, she had been imprisoned in jolfa prison for around seven years. the re-trial began in jolfa public court in november 2006. on 9 december 2006, hajieh was acquitted of the charge of adultery. hajieh esmailvand's conviction for being an accomplice to murder has not yet been reviewed by the supreme court. according to reports, her lawyer is planning to appeal this conviction. as hajieh esmailvand has already served the five year prison term that this charge carried, her release on bail is permanent. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - welcoming the news that hajieh esmailvand was acquitted of the charge of adultery and is therefore no longer at risk of execution by stoning; - recognizing that iran has a responsibility to bring to justice those suspected of criminal offences, but stating your unconditional opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, and urging that the death sentence of ruhollah g. be commuted. - stating your unconditional opposition to the death penalty, as the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and violation of the right to life; - calling for the abolition of execution by stoning in iran. appeals to: leader of the islamic republic: his excellency ayatollah sayed ali khamenei the office of the supreme leader shoahada

injected in arkansas on 2 may 2000. she has waived her appeals and said that she wishes to be executed. on the night of 4 november 1997, christina riggs killed her two children, justin dalton thomas (age 5) and shelby alexis riggs (almost 3). having sedated them with an anti-depressant, she planned to inject them with potassium chloride (the chemical used to stop the heart in us lethal injections), which she had got from the hospital where she worked. she did not realize, however, that it should be diluted before use. when she injected justin, therefore, he awoke in pain. she then gave him morphine and smothered him with a pillow. not wanting to inject shelby, she proceeded to smother her with a pillow also. she carried both children to her bed and lay them in it. she wrote a suicide note to her mother explaining her actions: i feel as if a dark cloud has hung over my life for many years...it seems that no matter how hard i try to better my life and the kids, i did nothing but make it worse... i hope that one day you will forgive me for taking my life and the life of my children, but i cant live like this any more and couldnt bear to leave my children behind to be a burden on you or to be separated and raised apart by their fathers and live knowing their mother killed herself. she then took a large quantity of anti-depressant pills and injected herself with potassium chloride concentrate. not being diluted, however, it ate a hole in her arm, collapsing her vein and never reaching her heart. the pills, enough to kill someone on their own, rendered her unconscious. she was discovered on the morning of 5 november and taken to hospital where she was stabilised in intensive care and kept under police guard. on the night of 5 november her family, who had still not been allowed to see her, hired a lawyer. before he arrived, however, the police took an eight-minute taped confession from christina riggs early on the morning of 6 november. much of her statement was inaudible as she was crying throughout, and towards the end appeared to be hallucinating. christina riggs was charged with two counts of capital murder. a pre-trial motion to suppress her hospital statement was rejected, and her trial began on 23 june 1998. she pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, that is, that at the time of the killings she was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct or to conform her conduct to the law. for the defence, a psychiatrist and a psychologist testified that her actions were the result of severe depression. they gave their opinion that, to her, the childrens deaths were an act of love and an extension of her own suicide. the psychologist said: the pathological suicidal depression that she was in.... effectively precluded her from being able to do something more reasonable, something more appropriate. from the outside looking in, the death of two children like this is pretty horrible. from the inside looking out, it looks like an act of mercy. for the state, a psychiatrist and a psychologist did not dispute that her suicide bid was genuine, but testified that they did not believe that she was sufficiently depressed to justify the defence of not guilty by reason of mental impairment. the jury agreed and convicted her of capital murder after less than an hour of deliberation. at the sentencing, christina riggs refused to have any evidence presented on her behalf and asked the jury for a death sentence: i want to die. i want to be with my babes. i started this out seven months ago. and i want you to give me the death penalty. i dont want you to feel guilty. the jury voted for a death sentence. christina riggs, who was sexually abused by a stepbrother between the ages of eight and 13, comes from a family with a history of mental illness and suicidal tendency. reportedly, her mother, sister, and a cousin all attempted suicide, and another cousin committed suicide.  her grandmother was twice committed to a mental institution, and her great-grandfather committed suicide in such an institution. her mother and siblings have been treated for depression. christina riggs own depression was reported to have been exacerbated by financial difficulties. she was a single mother working long shifts as a nurse. background information in the past two years about 20 people have been executed in the usa after giving up their appeals. for some, the decision to consent to their execution appears to be as a result of mental illness, and some had already attempted suicide. for others, the reasons may stem from physical illness, remorse, pessimism about their appeal prospects, or a wish not to live under the harsh conditions of death row. whatever the reason, it does not change the fact that the state is engaging in a human rights violation and deepening a culture of violence. the most recent consensual execution was that of 62-year-old james hampton in missouri on 22 march 2000. he had shot himself on arrest, and suffered from serious brain damage as a result. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, it has executed 626 prisoners, twenty-eight of them this year. recommended action: please send e-mails/faxes/express/airmail letters: - expressing concern that the state of arkansas is planning to execute christina riggs on 2 may 2000; - noting the evidence that she was suffering from severe depression when she killed her two children, and the history of mental illness in her family; - stating that the fact that a prisoner gives up their appeals does not absolve the state from its responsibility in this human rights violation; - urging the governor to stop the execution of christina riggs; - urging the governor to impose a moratorium in arkansas on this cruel and outdated punishment and to work towards abolition in line with the majority of the worlds countries. appeals to: the honourable mike huckabee governor of arkansas 205 state capitol

who has never denied the robbery - fled, shots were fired and lt oliver was killed by a single bullet. at the trial, the two police officers testified that they had not fired, but admitted that they had not seen workman shoot oliver.  an alleged eyewitness, harold davis, said that he had seen workman shoot the officer.  the defence lawyer conducted no forensic or ballistics analysis and did not investigate harold davis. since the trial, however, harold davis has retracted his testimony, saying he lied under police coercion.  an eyewitness has come forward to say that at least one of the other officers fired his gun.  ballistics experts have stated that the fatal bullet could not have come from workmans weapon, raising the possibility that lt oliver was killed by a shot fired by one of the other officers. five jurors from the original trial have signed affidavits that they would not have voted for a first-degree murder conviction, let alone the death sentence, if they had been presented with this evidence.  two state supreme court judges have suggested that clemency is merited in workmans case. in september 2000, the federal us court of appeals for the sixth circuit split 7-7 on whether to grant a hearing into the new evidence.  workman had needed one more vote. when the tennessee supreme court set the new execution date on 28 february 2001, one of the justices dissented.  justice birch believes that the court should make a formal recommendation to governor sundquist that workmans sentence be commuted because of two extenuating circumstances.  firstly, he believes that philip workmans death sentence is disproportionate and excessive: olivers death...was not brought about by any abnormally torturous or violent means compared to typical homicides.  the record reflects that the jury did not find that the murder was premeditated.  in addition, workmans criminal record as disclosed at trial does not include any prior violent crimes... in my view, when the facts and circumstances of this case are considered, they are far less egregious than the circumstances of most cases in which the tennessee supreme court has affirmed the sentence of death... indeed, the facts of this case are less egregious that the facts of many cases the court has reviewed in which a life sentence was imposed. secondly, justice birch wrote of the new evidence in the workman case: [i] t would not be improper to observe the uncontroverted fact that seven judges of the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit, including the chief judge, have concluded that workmans claims are sufficient to justify a formal hearing to more fully explore the merits of his claims.  moreover, it would not be improper to observe that, if true, workmans allegations would be particularly serious because the evidence he offers undermines the theory pursued by the prosecution at trial, and furthermore the evidence allegedly was beyond workmans reach at the time of his trial because of the actions of the prosecution [workmans appeal lawyers claim that the prosecution withheld x-ray evidence supportive of the contention that lt oliver was not killed by a bullet from workmans gun]... that workman may be executed without ever having been afforded an opportunity to prove his claims in an evidentiary hearing before any court should be deemed an extenuating circumstance which, in my view, justifies issuance of the certificate of commutation. the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. this is clearly a case where execution would violate this standard. in 2000, lt olivers daughter and the daughter of philip workman united at a press conference to appeal for the execution not to go ahead. further recommended action: please send e-mail/telegrams/faxes/express/ airmail letters in your own words, using the following guide: - expressing sympathy for the family, friends and colleagues of lieutenant ronald oliver, and stating that you do not condone violent crime; - expressing deep concern that philip ray workman is facing execution on the basis of perjured testimony from the only alleged eyewitness to the shooting; - noting that ballistics experts have stated that the fatal bullet could not have come from philip workmans gun; - noting that five jurors have said that they would not have voted to convict philip workman of first-degree murder, let alone vote for a death sentence, if they had known then what they know now; -

death penalty         7 june 2002 usa (texas)                  robert otis coulson robert coulson(m), white, aged 34, is scheduled to be executed in texas on 25 june 2002 for the murder of his sister and her husband in 1992. the charred bodies of five members of the coulson family were found after firefighters were called to a housefire in houston on 13 november 1992. the dead were robert coulsons adoptive parents, otis and mary coulson, their adopted daughters sarah coulson and robin coulson wentworth, and the latters husband richard wentworth. robert coulson was tried for the murder of robin coulson wentworth (his biological sister) and richard wentworth. the states theory at the june 1994 trial was that robert coulson had committed the murders in order to become the sole beneficiary of his parents $600,000 estate. he had allegedly arranged for his family to be at the house on 13 november 1992, had subdued them, bound their hands, covered their heads with plastic bags, poured petrol on their bodies and set them on fire (the autopsies indicated that the victims had died before the fire from asphyxiation caused by the bags). there was no physical or eyewitness evidence linking him to the crime. the case against him rested on the testimony of his alleged co-conspirator, jared althaus, who was also charged with capital murder but pleaded guilty in return for a 10-year sentence, of which he served five before being released on parole. the prosecution, after many attempts, were allowed to introduce as evidence an envelope and two photographs of it supposedly taken at the murder scene on the night of the murders. the back of the envelope had details of a proposed business loan to robert coulson discussed with his father earlier in the year, and was introduced to corroborate jared althauss claim that coulson had called his father to again discuss business and was expected at the house. the photos showed the envelope in a prominent position on the desk in otis coulsons study, suggesting that his father had placed it there in preparation for this further discussion. in his closing argument, the prosecutor urged the jury to regard the envelope as corroborating jared althauss testimony. during its deliberations at both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial, the jury specifically requested to see the envelope that was on the desk. on appeal, the state argued that the envelope was a significant piece of evidence simply because it was discovered on top of otis coulsons desk on the night of the murders . affirming the death sentence in 1996, the texas court of criminal appeals (tcca) noted that the probative value of the envelope evidence was that it was found on otis coulsons desk on the night of the murders...[which] tended to show that otis coulson was expecting to discuss appellants business plans around the time of the murders. evidence was subsequently produced showing that the photographs were not taken on the night of the murders, but the following day. a crime scene video did not show the envelope on the desk. it seems that the envelope had been found by investigators in a stack of papers under a paperweight on 14 october 1992 and moved by a police officer to be photographed in a more prominent position on the desk. on appeal, the federal courts agreed that the envelope evidence presented at trial was false, but ruled that it was harmless, despite the apparent importance placed on its location by the prosecutor, the jury, the state on appeal, and the tcca. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of questions of guilt or innocence, the seriousness of the crime, the existence or absence of mitigating evidence, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. the organization believes that every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, and every execution a symptom of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. a clear majority of countries  currently 111  have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. the international community has ruled out the death penalty as a sentencing option in international courts for even the worst crimes  genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. since resuming executions in 1977, 780 men and women have been put to death across the usa, more than 600 of them since 1990. texas accounts for 271 of these executions. fifteen of the 31 us prisoners executed this year have been killed in texas. more than 100 people have been released from death rows in the usa since 1973 after evidence of their innocence emerged. others went to their deaths despite serious doubts about their guilt. robert coulson has consistently asserted his innocence. while amnesty international is not in a position to assess the credibility of this claim, and opposes his execution in any event, it notes that the case against him involved no physical or eyewitness evidence linking him to the crime, while at the same time utilizing false evidence and a notoriously unreliable form of evidence - the testimony of a co-defendant facing capital murder charges before being granted a plea bargain to a lesser sentence. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - acknowledging the very serious nature of the crime against the coulson family, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of their deaths; - opposing the death penalty in this and all cases; - noting the error-prone nature of the us capital justice system, and expressing concern at the troubling aspects of this case, which involved false evidence and relied heavily upon an unreliable form of testimony, namely that of a co-defendant originally also facing capital murder charges; - citing the united nations safeguards relating to cases where there is any doubt about guilt; - calling for robert coulsons death sentence to be commuted. appeals to: gerald garrett chairperson texas board of pardons and paroles p.o. box 13401 austin, texas

- expressing deep concern that texas is set to carry out its 250th execution since resuming judicial killing in 1982; - pointing out that the use of the death penalty is doing immense damage to the international reputation not only of texas but of the usa as a whole; - urging governor perry to use his power and influence to stop the executions that come before him through his power of reprieve, to support a moratorium in texas, and to begin to lead his state away from the death penalty. to president bush: - expressing deep concern that texas is set to carry out its 250th execution, over half of which were carried out under his governorship; - noting the damage being inflicted upon the usa's international image by its use of the death penalty, frequently in violation of international standards; - noting that his administration must ensure that all jurisdictions in the usa, including texas, adhere to the country's international human rights obligations;

department members of the municipal governing board and others in cantabal amnesty international remains concerned for the safety of human rights activists, candidates and voters after several reports of violence and voting irregularities inthe first round of guatemala's elections on 9 november. rolando morales, congressional candidate for the unidad nacional de la esperanza (une), national party of hope and chief political advisor to presidential candidate lvaro colom, was shot and injured by unidentified attackers in the early hours of 9 november in zone 1 of guatemala city. he reportedly received two gunshot wounds but is said to be in a stable condition in hospital. it is feared that the attack may have been politically motivated. there are also concerns for the safety of elected mayor and unidad revolucionaria nacional guatemalteca (urng), national guatemalan revolutionary unity representative marcos ramrez, members of the municipal governing board and others connected with the elections in the town of cantabal, quich department. on 10 november, following the announcement of local election results, supporters of rival party the frente repblicano guatemalteco (frg), guatemalan republican front reportedly instigated a demonstration outside the offices of the national civil police and the tribunal supremo electoral (tse), supreme electoral tribunal in cantabal, in an attempt to force the head of the tse to nullify the election result. amnesty international is concerned that marcos ramrez and others involved in this election process may face further intimidation and harassment. reports currently suggest that oscar berger of the gran alianza nacional (gana), great national alliance, and lvaro colom of the unidad nacional de la esperanza (une), national union of hope, came highest in the national polls and will therefore go forward to a second election round on 28 december. amnesty international remains concerned that, in advance of the second round, there may be further political violence, intimidation and threats against voters, candidates and others involved with the election. since the start of the electoral campaign in may 2003, there have been reports of at least 21 election-related killings, as well as numerous acts of intimidation. although there were a number of reports of disturbances during the election, so far there have been no further reports of violence or harassment against human rights activists such as joji fukuyama, victoria dardn, victor rosa and others. background information violent incidents reported in the course of the elections include the burning of thirty ballot boxes in the indigenous communities of el quetzal, san marcos department and cuyutenango in suchitepquez department. in iztapa, escuintla department and palencia, guatemala department, some would-be voters were prevented from voting and ballot boxes were attacked and destroyed. three indigenous women, mara ijn escobar, catarina escobar and a third unnamed woman, were reportedly crushed to death when violence erupted in a crowd waiting for a polling station to open in the village of chajul, el quich department. it appears that some violent incidents occurred after voters became frustrated at delays and irregularities during the election process. some sources suggest that political interests, particularly that of the frg, may have been behind some of these incidents. allegations of fraud around the elections have also emerged, including the use of false identity cards and documents. administrative irregularities in a number of departments reportedly led to thousands of people being omitted from the electoral register and therefore denied the right to vote. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing concern about the attack on congressional candidate rolando morales and the intimidation of elected mayor marcos ramrez; - urging the authorities to carry out a thorough and impartial investigation into these incidents and to bring those responsible to justice; - calling on the authorities to ensure the safety of candidates, voters, human rights defenders, journalists and electoral observers during the electoral period between now and 28 december;

19 july 2002. he was sentenced to death in 1994 for his role in the murder of 17-year-old keith patrick young in monroe county in 1992. according to the trial evidence, the murder occurred in the early hours of 8 october 1992 following a party at which timothy carr and others consumed large amounts of alcohol, marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. timothy carr, melissa burgeson, keith young, and two 16-year-olds, left the party in the victims car. keith youngs body was found the next day. the two teenagers were tried in juvenile court in 1992 on murder and theft charges. one was found guilty on all counts, and sentenced to 18 months in juvenile detention. the other was convicted on the theft charge only and was ordered to receive counseling. of the two adults, melissa burgeson was tried first. timothy carr was advised by his lawyer to give a full confession to the monroe county prosecutor and to testify at burgesons trial. the lawyer said he had obtained a verbal assurance from the prosecutor that if carr  helped him, he would help carr. the lawyer said that he understood this to mean that carr would receive an offer of life imprisonment in return for a guilty plea. at burgesons trial in 1994, at which the prosecutor sought a death sentence, carr testified that he was very intoxicated at the time of the murder and had been compelled by burgeson to stab young. the prosecutor urged the jury to believe carrs testimony, and described burgeson as the least intoxicated of the suspects, and the moving force behind the crime. he also referred to timothy carr as burgesons puppet. the jury found burgeson guilty of murder, and sentenced her to life imprisonment. in 1999, an investigator from monroe county sheriffs department stated that as far as keith youngs death, i think [burgeson] played just as much a part in it as anybody...i think she instigated it, planned it and everything. he agreed with the prosecutors characterization of carr as burgesons puppet. timothy carr was tried two months after his co-defendant, and repeated his testimony from her trial. this time the prosecutor described carr as the prime mover in the crime. he urged the jury to discredit carrs  feeble defens and to disbelieve his account of having been intoxicated by alcohol and drugs and being influenced by burgeson. the jury, without knowing about burgesons life sentence, her reported history of violence and intimidation, including against carr, sentenced timothy carr to death. in june 2000, a state court judge overturned carrs death sentence. the court had found that his trial lawyer had committed serious errors which prejudiced the defense, including his failure to present a significant amount of mitigating information about [carrs] life history and the circumstances of the crime, including details of [carr ;s] extremely difficult childhood, evidence of physical and sexual abuse suffered by [carr] at the hands of his father, the history of alcoholism and mental illness in his family, evidence of a brain injury suffered at [carr ;s] birth, as well as good character evidence. having heard such evidence since the trial, one of the jurors has stated that it would have been powerful evidence that mr. carr was not the bad, irredeemable person the prosecutor wanted us to see. she continued: having finally heard about the story of tim carrs life, i dearly wish that this information had been presented at trial. it would have made a big difference. if i had had the information summarized here before me at the trial, i would have voted for a life sentence. a georgia jury must be unanimous before it can pass a death sentence. nevertheless, in march 2001 the georgia supreme court reinstated timothy carrs death sentence. on the mitigating evidence issue, the georgia supreme court ruled that the jury had heard enough to make their sentencing verdict reliable. the federal district court and 11th circuit court of appeals dismissed the case in a mere 13 months, a disturbingly short time given the particular importance of federal review in a case where there has been a conflict in state rulings. international safeguards require adequate legal representation for capital defendants at all stages of proceedings, above and beyond that provided in non-capital cases. in 1996, the united nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions emphasized that in capital cases all mitigating factors must be taken into account. the un guidelines on the role of prosecutors require prosecutors to at all times maintain the honour and integrity of their profession, and to perform their duties fairly, consistently and expeditiously,...thus contributing to ensuring due process and the smooth functioning of the criminal justice system. the monroe county prosecutor contravened such principles in his effort to achieve at least one death sentence. recommended action: please send appeals to

case is the domestic violence that characterized his upbringing. his older brother has stated that their father was an alcoholic who abused us bobby would get the worst of the abuse because he had blond hair and blue eyes. our father thought he was not his child. although we all took severe beatings around the head and body, bobby was most frequently the target of our fathers rage. his mother was physically abused by the father, and the children would witness this violence. bobby hines mother has recalled how the kids were scared all of the time from what they saw at home ; and confirmed that, of the children, bobby definitely got the worst of the abuse. background information texas is the leading death penalty state in the usa. as of 4 december, it had accounted for 312 of the 883 executions carried out nationwide since judicial killing resumed in 1977. texas has violated international law and standards in its pursuit of the death penalty, including by using it against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime, the mentally impaired, the inadequately represented, people whose guilt was in doubt, and foreign nationals denied their consular rights. since the atkins decision in june 2002, texas prosecutors have shown little inclination to take a progressive attitude towards the ruling. for example, in the current case of walter bell, a long-time death row inmate who has a strong claim of mental retardation, the local prosecution is challenging his claim despite having not disputed it at the original trial (at a time when the execution of people with mental retardation was constitutional). in an editorial on 25 november 2003, the austin-american statesman said of the case: in short, the jefferson county prosecutors are hell-bent on executing bell; the truth about his mental state is irrelevant and the requirements of the law are something to be evaded bell's case also is indicative of the failure of the legislature this year to rewrite state law to reflect the supreme court's ruling, and the failure of the executive branch, including the governor, to review the inmates on death row to see which ones should not be there because of mental retardation. recommended action: using the above information, please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in english or your own language, calling on the governor to intervene to prevent the execution of bobby hines in the event that the courts do not issue a stay to conduct further proceedings into his claim of mental retardation. please include bobby hines prisoner number #999025 in your appeals appeals to: the honorable rick perry governor of texas state capitol po box 12428 austin, tx 78711","","",5,TRUE

- urging that the arbitrary and massive use of the death penalty in china be stopped; - urging the chinese government to exclude non violent crimes, such as corruption, from the death penalty, as recommended by the united nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions;

- expressing dismay to the canadian authorities at their actions in sending fang yong back to china to face the death penalty; - reiterating to the canadian authorities the importance of fully investigating all refugee claims and all deportation cases for evidence that the immigrant would be tortured or face severe human rights violations including the death penalty. appeals to: please note that faxes in china are unreliable and often do not work outside office hours (10 hours before mountain daylight savings","","",2,TRUE

56 inmates have been executed this year, 26 of them in texas. the pace of execution in texas is coming under intense scrutiny, especially since the illinois governor suspended executions in his state because of its shameful record of wrongful convictions. the chicago tribune, the newspaper which had investigated the illinois death penalty prior to the january moratorium and found it to be riddled with injustice, recently concluded that the same problems were plaguing texas capital justice. the texas capital sentencing scheme, at which the jury is asked to predict future dangerousness, has long been criticized. as in many cases tried before the state law was changed in 1991 to require judges to instruct juries to take account of mitigating factors, oliver cruzs mental impairment, particularly given the prosecutors argument, is likely to have been interpreted as aggravating rather than mitigating evidence, as it may have led the jury to decide that such impairment would be likely to lead to future acts of violence. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/emails in your own words, using the following guide: - acknowledging the seriousness of the crime for which oliver david cruz is scheduled to be executed, and expressing sympathy for the relatives and friends of kelly elizabeth donovan;

murder committed in the course of theft, resisting or avoiding arrest; murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his/her duty; murder relating to illegal drugs or criminal gang activity. amnesty international (ai) fears that such a development would significantly increase the likelihood of numerous executions in belize in the coming years. the amendment, which has considerable public and political support needs only ninety days before action is taken to change the constitution accordingly. background information the judicial committee of the privy council (jcpc), located in the united kingdom, is currently the highest court of appeal for belize and other english speaking caribbean countries. currently all those sentenced for any crime in belize have the right of appeal. since a jcpc ruling in 1993, the death penalty can not be carried out if the prisoner concerned has been under sentence of death for more than five years, in which case the sentence is automatically commuted to life imprisonment. the last execution in belize was carried out in june 1985, when kent bowers was hanged. death by hanging is mandatory for murder in belize, except where extenuating circumstances can be proved. since 1985 numerous death sentences have been handed down, though none have been carried out. amnesty international understands that currently there are approximately nine people on death row. the new amendment bill sees the ruling party and the opposition united in their attempt to reinstate executions in belize, and follows public statements from leading politicians on both sides in support of capital punishment as a deterrent to the rising crime levels throughout the country. this sudden retrograde step comes only five months after the welcome ruling by the jcpc in march 2002, which upheld that the mandatory death penalty is in violation of the constitutions of seven caribbean states, including belize. whilst ai understands that this amendment will not apply to appeals and other proceedings currently in process, the fact that the death sentence is mandatory for murder means that the potential for numerous executions being carried out in belize in the future is of grave concern. amnesty international believes that such an amendment would deny equal standards of justice for all citizens, as it would still allow other criminal and civil case appeals to go to the jcpc. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases as a violation of the right to life and the ultimate form of cruel and inhuman punishment. the death penalty is irrevocable and can be inflicted on the innocent. it has never been shown to deter crime more effectively than other punishments and brutalises those involved in the process of executions and wider society as a whole. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing concern that the government of belize intends to remove rights from those whose lives it seeks to end that are available to those it only wants to imprison; - underlining that this step clearly runs counter to the worldwide trend towards the abolition of the death penalty, pointing out that in recent years, the governments of south africa, chile, east timor, ukraine, cote d'ivoire and angola have abolished the death penalty; - clearly stating that ai takes no position on the question of sovereignty, and acknowledges the right of countries to decide the legal structures appropriate for them, assuming the law is applied in a manner corresponding with international laws and standards, such as the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr); - expressing your unconditional opposition to the death penalty as a violation of one of the most fundamental of human rights - the right to life; - emphasizing that ais opposition to the death penalty in no way seeks to detract from the suffering of the victims of violent crime and of their relatives and friends. appeals to: prime minister rt. hon. said musa office of the prime minister new administrative building belmopan, belize","","",2,TRUE

by being branded' with a red-hot iron and by an electric drill applied to their limbs, shredding their muscles. according to a bbc report, iranian state television said that said qanbar zahi was tried on 11 march 2006. amnesty international has no other information concerning the legal proceedings faced by the seven, but there are concerns that they may have faced summary trials, and may not have had access to defense lawyers. amnesty international recognizes the rights and responsibilities of governments to bring to justice those suspected of criminal offences, but opposes the death penalty in all cases as the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. moreover, iran is a state party to international treaties which prohibit the execution of those under the age of 18 at the time of their alleged offence. background information iran's baluchi minority lives mainly in the southeast of the country, and is believed to constitute between one and three percent of the total population of around 70 million. mainly sunni muslims, they have for many years complained of discrimination by the iranian authorities. jondallah, or the iranian peoples resistance movement, has carried out a number of armed attacks on iranian officials and has on occasion killed hostages. it reportedly seeks to defend the rights of the baluchi people, though government officials have claimed that it is involved in drug smuggling and has ties to terrorist groups and to foreign governments. amnesty international condemns unequivocally the killing of hostages and urges jondallah to desist from this or similar practices immediately. according to a bbc report on 15 march, sistan-baluchistan television has stated that at least two people have been hanged in connection with the attack on the bus carrying revolutionary guards. five days after it took place, an iranian baluchi man, nasrollah shanbeh-zehi, was executed in connection with the attack. he was shown on iranian television confessing to the bombing on behalf of jondallah and was executed in public at the site of the bombing. it is thought that the other man allegedly executed in connection with the attack may have been ahmad sariz, allegedly a member of jondallah, who was reportedly hanged on 14 march. reports indicate that at least 17 other individuals have either been sentenced to death or executed in connection with an attack in tasuki in march 2006, in which up to 22 people were reportedly killed. in an interview with the iranian newspaper ayyaran on 17 march, hossein ali shahryari, a parliamentarian representing the city of zahedan, stated that prisons in sistan-baluchistan province hold more than 700 people under sentence of death. in 2006, at least 177 people were executed in iran, including at least four women and four people who were under 18 at the time of the alleged offence. possibly as many as one-third of these were members of irans baluchi minority. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - stating that amnesty international recognizes the right and responsibility of governments to bring to justice those suspected of criminal offences, but opposes the death penalty as the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment;

[t]he race of victim effect was found at all stages of the criminal justice system process. no remedial action was taken. between 1910 and 1961, north carolina executed 282 blacks and 75 whites. although 13 of the 15 people it has executed since 1977 have been white, 14 of the 15 were convicted of killing white people. over 55 per cent of the states 232 death row prisoners are black. the population of north carolina is 75 per cent white, and 22 per cent black. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters: - acknowledging the seriousness of the crime, and expressing sympathy for the family and friends of kimberly crews; - expressing concern that michael sexton was convicted by a jury from which all but one african american had been removed by the prosecution; - expressing concern that this case fits a pattern of racial bias in the use of the death penalty in the usa; - noting that there is a legislative committee currently investigating the impact of race in north carolinas use of the death penalty; - stating that it would be unconscionable for this execution to proceed when the condemned man could yet benefit from the committees findings; - urging the governor to commute michael sextons death sentence and to support a moratorium on executions in north carolina. appeals to: governor james b. hunt jr. office of the governor state capitol 116 west jones st. raleigh, nc 27603","","",3,TRUE

jaturun siripongs, thai national, aged 43 jaturun siripongs is scheduled to be executed on 9 february 1999.  he was sentenced to death in 1983 for the murder of packovan wattanaporn and quach nguyen during a robbery at pantai market in garden grove, california, in 1981, 18 months after he arrived in the usa from thailand. siripongs came within six hours of execution in november 1998.  he had had his final meal when he was granted a stay by a federal judge on the grounds that governor wilson may have denied the prisoner due process when he denied clemency. the judge lifted the stay in early december, noting that siripongs would have another opportunity to request clemency.  that request will be considered by the new governor who took office in january 1999. the clemency petition raises doubt about whether jaturun siripongs committed the double murder. he does not deny that he took part in the robbery but maintains that an accomplice, whom he refuses to identify because he does not want to shirk his own responsibility in the crime, killed the two people without his consent.  there is evidence to indicate that cuts sustained to jaturun siripongs hands during the robbery were caused when he tried to prevent the stabbing of one of the victims, rather than as a result of wielding the knife himself. siripongs current lawyers maintain that a witness called by the prosecution at the trial to testify that she was not present at the crime, may have been the accomplice and actual killer. according to the clemency petition, there were fingerprints, blood, and a clump of hair left at the scene of the crime which came from neither the victims nor jaturun siripongs. the latters lawyers are calling for, at the very least, a reprieve so that this and other physical evidence can be scientifically tested. after his arrest, jaturun siripongs should have been informed of his right to contact and seek assistance from the thai consulate, as provided by article 36 of the vienna convention on consular relations, ratified by the usa in 1969. however, like most of the more than 70 foreign nationals currently on death row in the usa, he was not informed of this right. access to consular legal expertise and resources, such as interpreters and cultural advice, can be crucial in a capital system where defence representation at trial is often shown to be inadequate. at jaturun siripongs trial, his defence lawyer reportedly tried to convince the jury that the defendant had not been at pantai market at the time of the crime, despite siripongs telling him that he had participated in the robbery. in addition, the lawyer did not investigate or present any mitigating evidence to the jury concerning jaturun siripongs life in thailand, marked by a seriously unstable and deprived childhood. by all accounts, jaturun siripongs has been a model prisoner in san quentin prison where he has continued to study and live by his buddhist beliefs.  before his previous execution date in november 1998, one prison officer wrote a note to him: ""at this time, not knowing what to say, i want you to know that knowing you and having worked for you has enriched my life."" another officer supports clemency ""based on his contribution to the safety and well-being of correctional officers and other inmates.""  in 1998 a former warden of san quentin wrote to governor wilson ""to urge your favourable consideration of clemency"", concluding that ""clemency will promote the safety and security of the institution. this former warden favours the death penalty and has never previously supported clemency. several jurors from the original trial have since expressed reservations about the appropriateness of the sentence. for example, one has appealed for clemency after learning about siripongs background for the first time, his ""adjustment to prison"", and his ""questionable defence"" at trial. suruchai wattanaporn, the widower of packovan wattanaporn, has also stated that, as a buddhist, he does not seek revenge for his wifes death and in november wrote to governor wilson appealing for clemency for jaturun siripongs. neither do the relatives of quach nguyen seek his execution. the thai government has also appealed for clemency, stating that it is willing to imprison him in thailand if his death sentence is commuted. the governor has sole power to grant clemency. this will be the first request for clemency to come before governor davis since he assumed office. there are over 500 people under sentence of death in the state, the largest death row in the usa.  five prisoners have been executed there since 1977, most recently thomas thompson on 14 july 1998.  in the same period, 508 inmates have been put to death nationwide.  the most recent

tolerating executions of defendants who have an inadequate defense is equally wrong. the paper concluded that minority defendants start out with an intolerable and indefensible disadvantage compared to white defendants...black citizens are under-represented on juries. prosecutors often excuse potential black jurors because they are less likely to vote for a death penalty conviction. a state legislative committee is reviewing the impact of race in north carolinas capital sentencing. the committee is due to report back and make recommendations to the states general assembly next year. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 670 prisoners have been put to death, including 72 this year. there are growing calls for a moratorium in light of concern about the fairness and reliability of capital justice. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - acknowledging the seriousness of the crime, and expressing sympathy for the family and friends of amelia lewis;

as prosecutors know, gays and lesbians are routinely subject to invidious bias in all corners of society...the openly gay defendant thus finds himself at a disadvantage from the outset of his prosecution. when a prosecutor directs the jury to make its guilt-innocence or life-death determination on the basis of anti-homosexual bias, that disadvantage is magnified exponentially and raises constitutional concerns. this is so because prosecutors occupy a position of trust, and their exhortations carry significant weight with juries... justification for these remarks was unquestionably illegitimate. exploiting his position of trust and spinning the reality of anti-gay prejudice to a pivotal position in the capital-sentencing phase, the prosecutor undermined the possibility that petitioners sentence would be based on reason rather than emotion. the united nations guidelines on the role of prosecutors requires that prosecutors perform their duties fairly, consistently and expeditiously, and respect and protect human dignity and uphold human rights, and  carry out their functions impartially and avoid all political, social, religious, racial, cultural, sexual or any other kind of discrimination. the right to freedom from discrimination on the basis of sex, which includes sexual orientation, is recognized in international treaties, including the international covenant on civil and political rights. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. today, 111 countries have abolished judicial killing in law or practice. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 810 prisoners have been put to death nationwide, 52 of them in oklahoma. prosecutorial conduct is one of the issues highlighted in amnesty internationals april 2001 report on the death penalty in oklahoma, old habits die hard (amr 51/055/2001). jay neill has chosen not to have a clemency hearing before the pardon and parole board. amnesty international understands that this is in order to spare the murder victims families more suffering. in the absence of a recommendation from the board, the governor of oklahoma has the authority to grant temporary reprieves. he should do so here, and use his power and influence to achieve commutation of jay neills death sentence. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - explaining that you are not seeking to minimize the seriousness of the crime, or the suffering it will have caused to many people; - expressing concern at the prosecutors blatant misconduct in raising jay neills homosexuality when arguing for a death sentence against him; - arguing that the prosecutors homophobic conduct must surely undermine confidence in the jurys decision, even for advocates of the death penalty, and also violated international standards for prosecutorial behavior; - calling on the governor to do all in his power and influence to stop this execution in the interests of fairness, equality, decency and the reputation of oklahoma and the usa. appeals to: frank keating governor of oklahoma room 212, state capitol building oklahoma city, ok 73105","","",2,TRUE

arkansas, colorado, georgia, indiana, kansas, kentucky, maryland, nebraska, new mexico, new york, tennessee and washington - now forbid the execution of the mentally retarded. in nebraska, for example, clarence victor was taken off death row on 30 june 1999 after tests placed his iq at 65. nebraska law makes it illegal to execute anyone with an iq below 70. a bill in the texas legislature, exempting inmates with an iq of 65 or less from execution, failed to pass into law in late may 1999. governor bush reportedly opposed the bill. on 5 may an editorial in the dallas morning news, stated: the moral sentiment behind such bans is simple: the state should not kill prisoners who cannot fully understand the concept of death. to use the ultimate punishment against people who cannot comprehend it is an act of vengeance, not an act of justice. governor bush is currently out of state. lieutenant governor perry will oversee charles boyds case. he has the power to grant a 30-day reprieve without the recommendation of the board of pardons and paroles, but cannot commute the sentence unless the board recommends it.  as well as seeking commutation, boyds lawyers are asking the lt governor for a 30-day reprieve so that they can complete forensic tests relating to the crime. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters in english or your own language: -

any execution serves only to create more victims and deepen a culture of violence. more than 400 prisoners have been executed in the usa since 1992, including 59 in 1999. in resolution 1989/64, adopted on 24 may 1989, the united nations economic and social council recommended that un member states eliminate the death penalty ""for persons suffering from mental retardation or extremely limited mental competence, whether at the stage of sentence or execution"". the last person executed in north carolina was james david rich on 26 march 1999. the governor has sole authority to grant clemency. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: - expressing concern that joseph timothy keel is scheduled for execution; - expressing concern that due to attorney error he has been denied post-conviction review in the state courts, and the right to full disclosure of state files on his case (you may cite the charles munsey case); - expressing concern that claims of the full extent of his mental health, drug and alcohol problems have not been heard in court; - noting that joseph timothy keels iq, measured at 78, puts him in the borderline mental retardation range, and pointing out that it is now 10 years since governments agreed that the death penalty should not be used against prisoners who suffer from mental retardation;
